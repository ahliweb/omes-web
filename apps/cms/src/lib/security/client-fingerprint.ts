/**
 * Issue #145 — audit attributes for authentication events need to answer
 * "which source is this?" (brute-force / credential-stuffing forensics)
 * without persisting a raw client IP.
 *
 * A raw IP cannot go into audit `attributes`: `src/modules/_shared/redaction.ts`
 * deliberately treats `ip`/`ipAddress`/`clientIp`/`remoteAddr`/`x-forwarded-for`
 * as sensitive and would replace the value with `"[REDACTED]"` anyway — an
 * unusable, permanently blank column. Renaming the key to dodge that redaction
 * would be a security regression, not a fix.
 *
 * A *keyed* hash resolves both requirements at once: the stored value is
 * stable, so an operator can group audit rows by source ("40 `login_failed`
 * rows, same `ipHash`, 40 different accounts" — the exact signal the audit
 * exists for), while the address itself is not recoverable from the audit
 * trail.
 *
 * Keyed (HMAC) rather than a plain digest on purpose: the IPv4 space is only
 * 2^32, so an unsalted `sha256(ip)` is exhaustively reversible in seconds and
 * would be pseudonymization in name only.
