/**
 * changelog.mjs — reading one version's section out of a CHANGELOG.md-shaped
 * document.
 *
 * ## Why an unrecognised `##` heading is refused rather than skipped
 *
 * `tools/rilis.mjs` writes every version heading in exactly one shape,
 * `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`, and nothing else in `CHANGELOG.md` is a level-2
 * heading — every subsection a folded changeset contributes is demoted to
 * `###` or deeper first (see that script's own comment on why). That makes
 * "the next `##` heading" an unambiguous end-of-section marker, but only for
 * as long as every `##` heading actually has that shape.
 *
 * A heading format that drifts — a different dash, the brackets dropped, the
 * date moved before the version — still starts with `## `, and a parser that
 * matches only on that prefix would keep splitting sections on it anyway:
 * the wrong prose ends up in the wrong version's notes, or two versions'
 * entries merge into one, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` (issue #181)
 * publishes whatever comes out as a GitHub Release with no diff for anyone
 * to notice it in. So every `## ` line is checked against the full expected
 * shape, and one that does not match throws immediately, naming the
 * offending line, instead of silently feeding a wrong split further downstream
 * — the same "refuse rather than guess" choice `semver.mjs` documents for a
 * version string.
 *
 * ## CRLF tolerance
 *
 * `.gitattributes` does not force `text=auto eol=lf` (see
 * `packages/gerbang/lib/changeset.mjs`'s own docblock for the same issue in
 * a sibling file), so a checkout with `core.autocrlf=true` can hand this
 * module a document with `\r\n` line endings. Line endings are normalised to
 * `\n` before anything is matched, so a heading is recognised the same way
 * either way, and the returned body is always LF-only.
