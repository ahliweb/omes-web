/**
 * The migration ledger only shrinks — proven in BOTH directions.
 *
 * `api:tenant-route:check` is only useful if it fails. Two failure directions
 * matter and they fail for opposite reasons:
 *
 * - a NEW route hand-rolls the opening and is not on the list (the regression
 *   the gate exists to stop);
 * - a listed route was migrated but the line stayed (the list rotting into an
 *   off-switch that excuses routes which no longer need excusing).
 *
 * `evaluateTenantRouteMigration` is exported pure precisely so both can be
 * asserted over synthetic contents, without a file tree and without a database.
 * The zero-files guard is exercised through the real filesystem walk in
 * `scripts/`, which the script's own `main()` covers.
