/**
 * Static, reviewed-source-code registry of module-contributed condition
 * resolvers and action handlers (Issue #747). Mirrors
 * `domain-event-runtime`'s `DOMAIN_EVENT_CONSUMERS`
 * (`src/modules/domain-event-runtime/infrastructure/consumer-registry.ts`)
 * exactly: a plain array, never a runtime `register(...)` call reachable
 * from a request handler — adding a real entry means editing THIS file
 * (reviewed source), never uploading/configuring one at runtime (doc 21
 * §3 decision tree, node Q5).
 *
 * Ships exactly one self-contained reference resolver and one
 * self-contained reference action — deliberately NOT tied to another
 * module's real business logic in this issue, matching the accepted
 * "foundation issue ships zero real business integrations" precedent
 * (#643 shipped zero real provider adapters; #742 shipped one
 * self-contained `sample.recorded` event + two reference consumers). A
 * domain module added directly to `src/modules/` (ADR-0034 removed the
 * derived-application pathway) adds its OWN entries here when it has a real
 * bounded predicate/side-effect to contribute.
