/**
 * Scheduled expiry job for business-scope assignments AND SoD conflict
 * exceptions (Issue #180 + #181, epic #177 Wave 2 authorization). Ported from
 * awcms-mini (`identity-access/application/business-scope-expiry-job.ts`,
 * Issue #746). #180 shipped the assignment sweep; #181 re-adds the
 * SoD-conflict-exception expiry pass (`awcms_sod_conflict_exceptions`).
 *
 * Built on the shared worker runner (`src/lib/jobs/job-runner.ts`'s `runJob`)
 * and `iterateTenantsInBatches` (`src/lib/jobs/batching.ts`), same shape as
 * `data-lifecycle`'s archive-purge job in mini: bounded per-tenant passes,
 * `withTenant` for RLS-scoped access even on the worker connection, resumable
 * after interruption (a later run simply finds the same still-`active`-but-
 * expired backlog again).
 *
 * "Temporary assignments automatically expire and are audited" (issue #180):
 * every transitioned assignment gets an
 * `awcms_business_scope_assignment_events` row (`event_type: "expired"`,
 * `actor_tenant_user_id: null` — a system/scheduled transition, not a human
 * action) PLUS one aggregate `recordAuditEvent` per tenant per pass
 * (count-only, avoiding one `awcms_audit_events` row per expired assignment
 * when a backlog is large); every transitioned SoD exception gets one
 * `recordAuditEvent` per row (`critical` severity — exceptions are
 * low-volume, and a compliance-sensitive override losing its cover is worth
 * an individually addressable audit entry). Flipping `status` here is a
 * BACKGROUND CLEANUP, not the gate: `isSoDConflictExceptionCurrentlyValid`
 * already treats an `approved` row past its `effective_to` as ineffective at
 * decision time, so expiry takes effect IMMEDIATELY (issue #181).
 *
 * ## Rows per pass, round trips per pass
 *
 * Which rows get written is unchanged by the batching below. HOW MANY
 * STATEMENTS write them is: each pass used to issue one INSERT per expired
 * item, and both passes are capped at 500, so the worst case was 500 sequential
 * statements inside one transaction — per tenant, per pass, across every
 * tenant `iterateTenantsInBatches` visits. A bound of 500 is not a defence
 * against a per-item query; it is the size at which one starts to matter.
 *
 * Now two statements per pass regardless: the assignment pass writes its event
 * rows with one `unnest`, and the exception pass writes its audit rows with
 * `recordAuditEvents`. Note that the second is the batch form of the SAME
 * writer the per-row loop used — the individually addressable entries the
 * paragraph above insists on are all still written, one row each.
 *
 * Flipping `status` to `expired` here is a BACKGROUND CLEANUP, not the
 * authorization gate: `isBusinessScopeAssignmentCurrentlyActive` already
 * treats an `active` row past its `effective_to` as not-in-force at decision
 * time (`business-scope-facts.ts`), so revocation/expiry takes effect
 * immediately regardless of when this job runs.
