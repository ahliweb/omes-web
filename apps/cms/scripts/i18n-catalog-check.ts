/**
 * `bun run i18n:catalog:check` — ADR-0095 §"Keputusan 4".
 *
 * Five questions, all mechanical, all pure (source text only — no database, no
 * network):
 *
 * 1. **Are the generated catalogs FRESH?** Recompile every `.po` and compare
 *    bytes. This is the check that turns `*.generated.ts` from a claim into a
 *    fact — a `.generated` file whose generator CI never runs is a lie this repo
 *    has already been told once.
 * 2. **Does every msgid the CODE uses exist in the catalogs?** Harvested from
 *    literal `t()` / `tn()` / `tx()` calls. A string nobody added to `locales/`
 *    can never be translated, and nothing else would ever say so.
 * 3. **Does each catalog's `nplurals` match the code's plural table?** The
 *    `.po` header is read to be VERIFIED, never evaluated.
 * 4. **How much of `id` is still untranslated?** Reported against a ledger that
 *    may only SHRINK.
 * 5. **Does every translation carry the SAME `{placeholders}` as its msgid?**
 *    The one translation defect a machine can see, and it is silent both ways.
 *
 * ## What this gate deliberately does NOT check
 *
 * Whether a literal English string somewhere FORGOT to be wrapped in `t()`.
 * That is a coverage question, not a consistency one, and fusing the two would
 * produce a gate that is green while every answer it gives is wrong — the
 * failure mode already recorded in this project's memory. The untranslated
 * ledger in check 4 is where incomplete coverage is made visible instead.
 *
 * It also cannot know whether a translation is CORRECT. Nothing mechanical can.

/**
 * Maximum `id` entries that may be declared-but-untranslated.
 *
 * A LEDGER, in the ADR-0094 §139→0 sense: it may only ever be lowered. Raising
 * it is how a translation debt becomes permanent, so raising it must be a
 * reviewed edit with a reason rather than the reflex fix for a red gate.
 *
 * **It went 0 → 718 → 0.** The raise to 718 was the one the original note
 * predicted: forty admin screens were migrated to `t()` in one pass, declaring
 * 1,074 new msgids, and 718 of them arrived ahead of their Indonesian. Holding
 * that migration back until every string had a translation would have parked
 * forty screens of mechanical change in an unreviewable branch, and wrapping the
 * strings WITHOUT declaring the msgids would have made them invisible to
 * translators — untranslatable rather than untranslated, and reported by nothing.
 *
 * What made the raise safe is that an untranslated entry is not a broken screen:
 * `createTranslator` falls back to the msgid, which IS the English source text
 * (ADR-0095 §"Keputusan 2"), so a reader saw correct English on the parts not yet
 * done rather than a leaked key or an empty element.
 *
 * That fallback is also why the debt could hide: every screen looked fine in both
 * locales. Only this counter said otherwise, which is the entire argument for
 * keeping the ledger at 0 rather than deleting it — at 0 it rejects the NEXT
 * msgid that lands without Indonesian, on the day it lands, instead of a year
 * later when somebody counts again.

 * harvester below matches string LITERALS only, so a variable call is skipped
 * by construction and needs no exemption — while the exemption additionally
 * hid that file's ten literal msgids, which are exactly the shell strings most
 * worth checking. An exemption that silences more than it was written for is
 * the failure mode this repo's gates keep re-learning.
 *
 * The variable calls are covered instead by
 * `tests/i18n-sidebar-labels.test.ts`, which asserts every value in
 * `SIDEBAR_LABELS` and every module display name is a catalog key. That reads
 * the actual tables rather than call syntax, so it is strictly stronger than
 * harvesting could be.

/**
 * A single-quoted/double-quoted/backticked string literal with no
 * interpolation. Simple escapes ARE accepted and decoded; anything more complex
 * is left UNHARVESTED rather than parsed approximately, because a harvester
 * that guesses produces phantom msgids, and a gate that reports a msgid nobody
 * wrote trains its readers to widen the ignore list until it asks nothing (the
 * lesson `permission-enforcement-check.ts` paid for four times).
 *
 * ## Why escapes had to be accepted rather than skipped
 *
 * This pattern originally excluded `\` outright, and the rejection was
 * described as conservative. It was not. **Prettier rewrites an em dash inside
 * a `t()` literal as `—`**, and this admin's prose is full of em dashes —
 * so 86 distinct msgids were invisible to check 2 below, which is the check
 * that makes a msgid REQUIRED to exist in the catalogs.
 *
 * The consequence is silent and one-directional: an unharvested msgid is never
 * demanded, so it is never added to `locales/`, so `createTranslator` falls
 * back to the msgid — correct English, forever, in every locale, with the
 * untranslated ledger reading 0 the whole time. The strings most likely to be
 * hit are the LONG ones, which is exactly where a reader most needs their own
 * language.
 *
 * Decoding matches `decodeEscapes` in `src/lib/i18n/po.ts` deliberately: the
 * comparison is only sound if source and catalog agree on what the text IS. An
 * unknown escape still skips the literal, for the same reason the `.po` parser
 * rejects one — it is far more likely a typo than an intentional backslash.
