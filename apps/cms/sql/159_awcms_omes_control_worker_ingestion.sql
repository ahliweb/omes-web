-- Issue ahliweb/omes#199 (ADR-0122) — worker enrollment/poll/result/heartbeat
-- ingestion schema. Additive only; 154-158 are untouched.
--
-- Adds:
--   * awcms_omes_worker_nonces      — atomic nonce/replay store for the
--     session-unauthenticated, asymmetric-identity-authenticated worker
--     endpoints (poll/result/heartbeat). A worker request is verified by an
--     Ed25519 signature over a canonical string, not by a session, so this
--     table is the only thing standing between a captured-and-replayed
--     request and a second execution. Consumption is a single
--     `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, worker_id, nonce) DO NOTHING
--     RETURNING id` — the same atomic-CAS-via-unique-index pattern
--     `awcms_idempotency_keys` already uses (never a read-then-write, and
--     never `err.code === "23505"`, which is dead code on this driver: the
--     Postgres SQLSTATE Bun.SQL surfaces is on `error.errno`).
--   * awcms_omes_worker_results     — canonical, idempotent ledger of what a
--     worker REPORTED for a job. Deliberately separate from
--     `awcms_omes_jobs.result` (#198): every row is stamped
--     `source = 'worker_reported'` and `reconciled = false` by default, so no
--     reader of this table can mistake "the worker said succeeded" for
--     "OMES independently confirmed it succeeded" — a 2xx response to
--     POST /api/v1/omes/worker/result is an acknowledgement of receipt, never
--     a verdict. Reconciliation (flipping `reconciled`) is intentionally left
--     to a future evidence cross-check against `awcms_omes_health_snapshots`/
--     `awcms_omes_audit_projections`, out of this issue's scope, so the
--     column defaults closed rather than never existing.
--   * awcms_omes_jobs.operation_request_id gets a PARTIAL UNIQUE index — the
--     promotion of an `approved` operation_request into a queued job
--     (application/worker-job-queue.ts, needed for the poll endpoint to have
--     anything to lease — #198 only ever left operation_requests in
--     'approved' and never itself wrote a job row) must create AT MOST ONE
--     job per operation_request even under concurrent pollers; this index is
--     the DB-level backstop behind that promotion's own `FOR UPDATE SKIP
--     LOCKED` claim.
--   * awcms_omes_servers gets `last_heartbeat_evidence jsonb` — redacted,
--     worker-reported telemetry (omes_version/contract_version/capability
--     digest/uptime/last_reconciliation_at) attributed explicitly to
--     `omes-host` self-report, never merged into anything that could be read
--     as independently-verified health.

-- name collision with the "OMES pull-worker" this whole issue is about, see
-- module.ts's dataLifecycle entry below) gets SELECT+DELETE ONLY, the exact
-- same generic-purge shape `sql/156` already narrowed every other
-- omes_control table to: a future retention sweep needs to scan and delete
-- expired nonce rows, never insert one. `scripts/security-readiness.ts`'s
-- `WORKER_ROLE_GRANTS` matrix is updated in the same PR to expect exactly

-- 2. Worker-reported job results ledger --------------------------------------
--
-- Keyed by `idempotency_key`, NOT the wire `job_id` — reading the actual
-- OMES-side reference worker (`lib/omes/py/jobs/worker.py`) shows `job_id`
-- in `worker-result.request` is the WORKER's own local job-store id
-- (`store.submit()`'s return value), never something AWCMS assigned or can
-- predict: `operation-request.schema.json` (what a poll response's `job`
-- object must conform to) has no `job_id` property at all — only
-- `correlation_id` and `idempotency_key` are AWCMS-assigned and therefore
-- the only stable cross-system correlation handles. `job_id` is still
-- required by the pinned `worker-result.request` schema and is stored here
-- (`worker_job_id`) for observability, but it is opaque, worker-chosen
-- metadata, never a join key.

-- reference reasoning as the nonces FK above, tightened one step further
-- (CONFIRMED LOW, independent review of PR #823): the FK originally matched
-- only (tenant_id, idempotency_key), which is weaker than the INTENT this
-- table's own unique index (`awcms_omes_worker_results_idem_idx`, just
-- above) already declares — `(tenant_id, server_id, idempotency_key)`. A
-- narrower FK does not by itself let a result reference a job under the
-- wrong server (idempotency_key is randomly generated and effectively
-- unique per tenant regardless), but it left the FK's declared guarantee
-- weaker than the table's own uniqueness promise, which is confusing to
-- read and one duplicated-value collision away from meaning something
-- different than intended. Both now agree.

-- constraint on a nullable column still allows any number of NULL rows (NULL
-- is never considered equal to NULL), which is exactly what is needed here:
-- every job this issue's promotion path creates always sets
-- idempotency_key, but the column stays nullable for forward compatibility
-- with any future job-creation path that legitimately has none.
