/**
 * visitor-analytics-purge.ts — `bun run analytics:purge`.
 *
 * Scheduled worker entrypoint for `purgeVisitorAnalyticsData`
 * (`src/modules/visitor-analytics/application/retention-purge.ts`) — the same
 * function the on-demand `POST /api/v1/analytics/retention/purge` endpoint
 * calls, run here for every active tenant so retention is enforced without a
 * user action.
 *
 * Built on the shared job runner (`src/lib/jobs/job-runner.ts`): advisory
 * lock, timeout, SIGTERM/SIGINT-aware cancellation, JSON telemetry, exit
 * code. Pure PostgreSQL operation, safe in offline/LAN deployments. Runs as
 * the least-privilege `awcms_worker` role (sql/022) when
 * `WORKER_DATABASE_URL` is configured.
 *
 * Audit note (accepted asymmetry, base-consistent): unlike the on-demand
 * `POST /api/v1/analytics/retention/purge` endpoint (which writes a `critical`
 * audit event), this SCHEDULED run is not audited to `awcms_audit_events` — its
 * record of record is the job runner's JSON telemetry (job-telemetry-as-record),
 * the same posture as the other scheduled retention/rollup jobs in this base.
 *
 * Retention windows come from the module's env config
 * (VISITOR_ANALYTICS_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS / _RAW_DETAIL_RETENTION_DAYS /
 * _ROLLUP_RETENTION_DAYS). `--dry-run` reports the tenant count without
 * deleting/clearing anything.
