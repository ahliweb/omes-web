/**
 * edge-cache-surfaces-check.ts — `bun run edge-cache:surfaces:check`.
 *
 * ADR-0042 registry gate, part of `bun run check`. Pure: no database, no
 * network. It runs in CI on every change because the surface registry is an
 * allow-list that decides what a shared cache may store — a mistake in it is a
 * cross-tenant disclosure, not a performance bug, and it is exactly the kind of
 * mistake that reads fine in review.
 *
 * The check that earns this file's existence is #3: it probes every declared
 * pattern against a list of paths that must NEVER be cacheable. A regex like
 * `/^\/blog\/.*​/` looks reasonable in a diff and quietly matches
 * `/blog/../admin/users`. Asserting the property directly is far more reliable
 * than asking a reviewer to simulate regexes in their head.
