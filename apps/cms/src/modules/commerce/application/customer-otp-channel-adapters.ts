/**
 * Concrete `CustomerOtpChannel` adapters (Issue #89, contract #86/ADR-0016
 * D2) — `email` (the real path) and `log` (dev/CI, no mail credentials
 * needed). Owned by `commerce` itself, the same way `newsletter`'s
 * `subscribe.ts` calls `email`'s `enqueueDirectAddressEmail` directly rather
 * than through a port owned by `email` — this module already depends on
 * `email` for exactly this reason (see `module.ts`).
 *
 * ## Category registration happens HERE, at import time
 *
 * `registerDerivedEmailTemplateCategory` must run before any template using
 * `derived.commerce_customer_otp` is created/validated/rendered. This file
 * is imported by every composition root that can send an OTP (the
 * `otp/request` route, and any test that exercises the real adapter), so the
 * side effect fires before first use — the same "registered before use"
 * guarantee `newsletter`'s own derived category documents but (see its own
 * header) never actually wires up; this module does not repeat that gap.
