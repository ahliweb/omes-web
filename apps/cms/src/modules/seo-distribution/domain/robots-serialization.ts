 * `robots.txt` serialization (ADR-0038 §4). Pure: turns the tenant's

 * robots.txt body.
 *
 * ## Safe by construction — no tenant-authored directive lines
 *
 * A tenant CANNOT inject arbitrary robots.txt lines. The only tenant inputs that
 * shape this file are structured booleans (`siteNoindex`, `sitemapEnabled`); the
 * directive lines themselves are fixed strings chosen here. This is the
 * "robots directives within safe bounds" the ADR requires: raw per-path rules
 * are deliberately NOT tenant-editable (that would be a line-injection surface on
 * the operator's shared robots.txt), so there is no user string to escape here at
 * all. The absolute `Sitemap:` URL is built only from the SERVER-DERIVED primary
 * host (never the request `Host`), and only when one is verified.
