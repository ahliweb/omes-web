# `idn_admin_regions` — Indonesia administrative regions

Versioned master data for Indonesia's administrative hierarchy — **province /
regency-city / district / village** — admitted by
[ADR-0046](../../../docs/adr/0046-idn-admin-regions-module-admission.md).

## Source, licence, and the claim this module does NOT make

The data comes from the third-party community project
[`cahyadsn/wilayah`](https://github.com/cahyadsn/wilayah) (MIT), vendored under
`data/idn-admin-regions/` with its licence, upstream commit, per-file checksums,
and per-file decree reference.

**This is not an official Kementerian Dalam Negeri (Kemendagri) API or export.**
It is a community packaging of the Kepmendagri decree — AWCMS never claims to
publish this data, and it does not replace an operator's own legal/compliance
reference to the decree itself. The imported file (`db/wilayah.sql`) cites
**Kepmendagri No 300.2.2-2138 Tahun 2025**.

That caveat lives in exactly one place in code —
[`domain/source-provenance.ts`](domain/source-provenance.ts) — and is re-read by
the dataset API response and the admin screen, so the three can never drift.

## Why this data is GLOBAL, and what replaces RLS

Province "Aceh" is the same row for every tenant. Both tables therefore have **no
`tenant_id`, no RLS, and no policy** — the same posture as `awcms_permissions`
and `awcms_modules`. Duplicating 91,599 rows per tenant would turn reference data
into storage that grows with the customer list and make "is every tenant on the
same region version?" unanswerable.

What replaces RLS is **not** trust:

- both tables are registered in `GLOBAL_TABLE_FORBIDDEN_PRIVILEGES`
  (`scripts/security-readiness.ts`), which forces an explicit per-role privilege
  declaration instead of inheriting blanket DML from `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`;
- `awcms_app` holds `SELECT` on both plus `UPDATE` on the dataset table only
  (activation); `awcms_worker` holds the insert path; **neither holds `DELETE`**;
- every endpoint still runs session → tenant context → default-deny RBAC/ABAC.
  What is global is the ROW, not the authorization.

## Versioning: import, activate, roll back

```text
import (job)            activate (admin action)        rollback (admin action)
  ─────────►  validated  ──────────────────────►  active  ─────────────►  superseded
                                                    ▲                          │
                                                    └──────────────────────────┘
```

- **Import** parses the vendored dump as **text** (no SQL engine, no MySQL, no
  network), validates it whole, and writes one new dataset **beside** the
  previous one — never over it. That is what makes rollback a status flip
  instead of a re-import.
- A new dataset always lands `validated`, never `active`: importing is a
  deployment step, choosing what is SERVED is an operator decision that gets
  audited.
- **Only one dataset is active**, enforced by a partial unique index in the
  database — not by an application check two concurrent requests could interleave
  through.

```bash
bun run idn-regions:import            # dry run: parse, validate, report, write nothing
bun run idn-regions:import --commit   # write one new dataset version
```

Re-running `--commit` on identical bytes is a no-op: the dataset code is derived
from the upstream commit + file checksum, so it collides instead of creating a
duplicate version.

## Validation refuses partial hierarchies

An import fails — rather than importing what it could — when any of these hold:

| Condition                               | Why it is fatal                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A line does not match the value grammar | Regions would be silently missing, and nothing would say so      |
| A duplicate region code                 | The dataset contradicts itself about a real place                |
| A region whose parent is absent         | A hierarchy missing its middle breaks pickers, invisibly         |
| A tier with zero rows                   | Structurally not a full hierarchy — most likely a truncated file |
| Checksum ≠ the manifest                 | The recorded provenance would be fiction                         |

## A failed import is now visible ([Issue #768](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms/issues/768))

`awcms_idn_region_datasets.status` always admitted `rejected` (`sql/080`'s
CHECK constraint), but nothing ever wrote it: a failed import wrote **no**
dataset row either, so the failure existed only in the shell/CI log of
whoever ran `--commit`. On `/admin/idn-regions`, "a dataset that failed to
import" and "a dataset never attempted" looked identical.

`bun run idn-regions:import --commit` now records the failure instead of
only reporting it:

- **Zero region rows are ever written** for a rejected attempt — that part of
  the design does not change.
- A `rejected` dataset row IS written, with the attempted dump's provenance
  (repository, commit, checksum, decree reference) and a `rejection_reason`
  (`sql/149`) — the same validation problems this command prints, joined by
  newline. It renders on `/admin/idn-regions` as **escaped text**, never HTML.
- The write is its **own committed statement**, independent of whatever import
  transaction did or did not open — the concern this exists to close is
  exactly a rejection row that vanishes with a rollback.
- **Re-running the same bad dump is a no-op on the row**: the dataset code is
  deterministic (commit + checksum), so the second attempt updates the
  existing `rejected` row's reason/timestamp in place (`ON CONFLICT … DO
UPDATE … WHERE status = 'rejected'`) rather than erroring on the unique
  constraint or piling up duplicates.
- A dry run (no `--commit`) still writes nothing at all, rejected row
  included — the "parse, validate, report" contract is unchanged.
- A `rejected` dataset can never be activated — `activateDataset` only accepts
  `validated` or `superseded` — and `/admin/idn-regions` never renders a
  "Serve this version" button for one.

## Lookup API

| Method + path                            | Permission     | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/idn-regions/regions`        | `region.read`  | `level`, `parentCode`, `search`, keyset `after` |
| `GET /api/v1/idn-regions/regions/{code}` | `region.read`  | One region + resolved ancestor path             |
| `GET /api/v1/idn-regions/datasets`       | `dataset.read` | Versions + provenance + caveat                  |

Every endpoint in this table is **read-only**. Activation and rollback are NOT
read-only and are NOT in this table, but they are not gone either — they are
reachable two ways:

```bash
# operator job — CI, a recovery shell, or a deployment whose platform tenant cannot log in
bun run idn-regions:activate -- --dataset <code|uuid>            # dry run
bun run idn-regions:activate -- --dataset <code|uuid> --commit   # serves it
bun run idn-regions:rollback --commit                            # undo
```

```http
# HTTP — the /admin/idn-regions console
POST /api/v1/idn-regions/datasets/{id}/activate
POST /api/v1/idn-regions/datasets/rollback
```

They change the dataset served to **every** tenant, which is exactly why the
permissions that gate the HTTP path (`dataset.configure`/`.restore`) are
`scope: "platform"` (ADR-0053, `sql/085`): excluded from the blanket catalogue
`setup/initialize` grants every new tenant's `owner`, and refused by the
authorization chokepoint unless the acting tenant IS the platform tenant. It was
not always this way — the permissions first shipped as ORDINARY tenant
permissions, so an ordinary tenant owner held authority over data served to
other tenants, which is exactly why
[ADR-0052](../../../docs/adr/0052-idn-region-dataset-lifecycle-is-an-operator-job.md)
deleted both the endpoints and the permissions for a day (`sql/084`): the
platform scope that could gate them safely did not exist yet.
[ADR-0053](../../../docs/adr/0053-platform-scoped-permissions.md) built it and
brought both back.

The two doors are not equivalent: the HTTP endpoint writes an
`awcms_audit_events` row, to the platform tenant's log; the operator job writes
none, because that table is tenant-scoped and this action is global — a
deliberate, documented cost of the job path, not an oversight.

Queries default to the **active** dataset; `?dataset=<code>` reads a specific
version, which is what makes keeping superseded versions worth the rows. With
nothing activated yet, list responses are empty and carry
`reason: "no_active_dataset"` — a fresh install is a real state, not an error to
debug.

## Deliberately not here

- **No `import` permission.** Import is a job, not an HTTP action; seeding a
  permission would advertise a surface that does not exist.
- **No capability port / no events.** Consumers read the API; nothing subscribes
  to region changes.
- **No `dataLifecycle` descriptor.** Versioned reference data is superseded, not
  aged out.
- **No island / population / area code.** Those three dumps are vendored from the
  same upstream commit, but nothing reads them yet.
- **Local term for districts is `null`.** Upstream ships bare district names;
  filling in "Kecamatan" would be wrong for the provinces whose tier is
  "Distrik". A null an operator can see beats a plausible value they cannot check.
