/**
 * Password-reset application logic (Wave 2 delta auth, adapted from awcms-micro
 * Issue #496) — the first real producer of `awcms_email_messages` in this repo.
 * Reuses what already exists rather than rebuilding auth: `login.ts`'s
 * tenant/identity/tenant_user active checks, `session-token.ts`'s token shape
 * (via `lib/auth/reset-token.ts`'s twin `generateResetToken`/`hashResetToken`),
 * and `tenant-auth-policy.ts`'s SSO-only rule.
 *
 * ## Enumeration-safe by construction
 *
 * `requestPasswordReset` returns `outcome: "ineligible"` for EVERY case a
 * caller must not be able to tell apart — unknown identifier, inactive
 * identity, inactive tenant-user, inactive tenant, SSO-only identity,
 * non-mailable identifier — and the endpoint responds with one fixed 200 body
 * for every outcome including success. The distinction survives only in the
 * audit trail, which is tenant-scoped, RLS-protected and never part of a
 * response.
 *
 * ## Three adaptations beyond the micro original
 *
 * 1. **SSO-only identities are refused.** `awcms` has a tenant auth policy
 *    (`password_login_enabled=false` + a break-glass allow-list, sql/025) that
 *    micro does not. Without this check, password reset would be a supported,
 *    unauthenticated way to mint a working password for an identity whose
 *    tenant deliberately turned password login off — a policy bypass with a
 *    friendly UI.
 * 2. **Delivery goes through a capability port**, not an INSERT into
 *    `awcms_email_messages`. That table belongs to `email` (ADR-0013 §6); the
 *    micro original wrote into it directly. See
 *    `_shared/ports/auth-notification-port.ts`.
 * 3. **A non-mailable `login_identifier` is ineligible** rather than enqueued
 *    (`isMailableLoginIdentifier`).
