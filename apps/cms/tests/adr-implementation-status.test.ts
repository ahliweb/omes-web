/**
 * An ADR's `Status` line must agree with the filesystem it makes promises about.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (C12, `docs/awcms/standar-performa-dan-keamanan.md` §9)
 *
 * Six ADRs — 0016, 0017, 0018, 0019, 0020, 0021 — are `Accepted` for artifacts
 * with no code in this repository: five module admissions whose modules were
 * never built here, and one contract family (ADR-0020) whose `_shared` files
 * were deleted along with the derived-application pathway (ADR-0034). The
 * assessment's demand was explicit: a gate binding ADR status to the existence
 * of the module/files, or a new status `Accepted (not yet implemented)`.
 * This delivers BOTH: the six ADRs now carry the qualified status, and this
 * test enforces the binding in both directions.
 *
 * ## How it differs from `tests/adr-admission-implementation-status.test.ts`
 *
 * That gate binds a prose banner to `listModules()` membership, and only for
 * ADRs titled `Admission of \`module_key\``. It cannot see ADR-0020 (a contract
 * ADR, not a module admission) and it does not constrain the `Status` line at
 * all — an ADR could read `Accepted` forever. This gate is map-driven over the
 * PROMISED ARTIFACT PATHS themselves, so it covers file-contract ADRs too, and
 * it constrains the status line:
 *
 * - (a) artifacts absent  → status MUST be `Accepted (not yet implemented)`;
 * - (b) artifacts present → status MUST be plain `Accepted` — landing the
 *   implementation forces the flip in the same PR;
 * - (c) a map entry naming an ADR file that does not exist fails — dead map
 *   entries are themselves failures, per this repo's gate-design convention;
 * - (d) the qualifier cannot be used off-map: any ADR carrying it must have a
 *   map entry, so the status can never float free of an artifact binding.
 *
 * The decision logic is a pure function over an injected snapshot and is
 * mutation-proven below: each direction has a test that feeds it the defect it
 * must catch. No database, no network — safe for `quality` on every PR.
