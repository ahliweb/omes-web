/**
 * knowledge-graph-update.mjs — `bun run knowledge:graph:update`.
 *
 * Rebuilds this workspace's OWN root Graphify graph — never `apps/cms`'s,
 * which already owns its own graph and its own gate (`bun run check:cms`).
 * Two real `graphify` calls, both verified directly against the installed
 * toolchain (0.9.35) while building this workflow:
 *
 *   1. `graphify extract . --code-only` — structural AST extraction only.
 *      No LLM call, no provider API key read, for any file, ever: the flag
 *      itself "index[es] code (local AST, no API key) and skip[s] doc/
 *      paper/image files". This is issue #11's explicit default — semantic
 *      extraction must be OFF by default and opted into by hand, never run
 *      by this repo's own scripts. See `knowledge/README.md`'s "Extraction
 *      mode" section for the full provider/network/token accounting.
 *   2. `graphify cluster-only .` — re-clusters and names communities.
 *      Verified: with no `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY`/other backend
 *      configured, this makes no network call either — it reuses any
 *      saved, human-chosen labels whose community membership is unchanged
 *      (`graphify-out/.graphify_labels.json` + its `.sig` sidecar) and
 *      falls back to deterministic, free hub-based naming
 *      (`label_communities_by_hub`) for anything new. A hub name is not an
 *      acceptable final label — `bun run audit:graf` rejects one — so a
 *      run that introduces a genuinely new community needs a human to
 *      rename it by hand afterwards, same discipline `apps/cms`'s own
 *      graph documents.
 *
 * Then records the run (`0`/`0` tokens, always, under `--code-only`) in
 * `graphify-out/cost.json`, in the same shape the interactive graphify
 * skill's own manifest step uses, so a future semantic run's nonzero totals
 * are visible against a history that was honestly zero before it.
 *
 * Needs the real `graphify` binary on `PATH` (a local Python tool, not
 * installed in CI). Not part of `bun test`.
