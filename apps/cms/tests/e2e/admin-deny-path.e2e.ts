/**
 * Every permission-gated admin screen actually DENIES a user who holds nothing.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * The per-screen contract tests are source greps — they prove a page mentions
 * a permission key, not that a control is hidden from someone lacking it. The
 * render smoke test (`admin-screens-render.e2e.ts`) loads every screen as the
 * seeded OWNER, who holds every permission. So nothing anywhere had ever
 * watched an admin screen answer a user with no permissions at all.
 *
 * That is the half of authorization worth checking at runtime. A screen can
 * name the right key, gate the right control, pass every static test, and still
 * render its contents — because the gate was written on a variable that is
 * `true` for the wrong reason, or because the deny branch was never exercised.
 *
 * ## What it asserts
 *
 * For all 47 gated screens, as a user whose role holds zero permissions:
 *
 * 1. **The denial renders.** `loadAdminScreen` never redirects (see
 *    `src/lib/auth/admin-screen.ts`), so a denied screen renders an element
 *    carrying `id="…-denied"`. `tests/admin-deny-path-contract.test.ts` keeps
 *    that hook present in the source; this requires it to actually appear.
 * 2. **The status is 200.** A denial is a rendered page, not an error. A 404
 *    here would mean the screen THREW — the `/admin/seo` class — and a throw
 *    must never be mistaken for a refusal.
 *
 * Soft assertions throughout: a run should report every screen that leaks, not
 * stop at the first.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT assert
 *
 * That a PARTIALLY-permissioned user sees the right subset. Expected results
 * differ per screen there, so it is per-screen knowledge rather than one
 * mechanical rule, and it is a larger piece of work. This covers the case where
 * one rule holds for every screen.
