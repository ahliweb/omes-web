/**
 * Content quality checklist (Issue #640, epic `news_portal`) — pure rule
 * evaluation. Deliberately mirrors Issue #636's own mode-gating precedent
 * (`news-media-reference-gate.ts`): this ENTIRE checklist is a no-op
 * (`applicable: false`) unless full-online R2-only mode is genuinely active
 * for the calling tenant (checked by the caller, `content-quality-checklist-
 * gate.ts`, via `MediaLibraryPort.isManagedMediaEnforcementActiveForTenant` — this
 * file never touches a database or the port itself, staying pure/testable
 * like every other `domain` file in this module). The overwhelming majority
 * of `blog_content`-only tenants (no news-portal R2-only preset applied) see
 * ZERO behavior change from this issue — publish/schedule works exactly as
 * before Issue #640. This is a deliberate scope decision (not an oversight):
 * forcing a NEW blocking editorial gate (missing meta description, missing
 * taxonomy, etc.) onto every generic `blog_content` tenant would be exactly
 * the "blanket tightening of a feature that's supposed to stay opt-in"
 * mistake this epic's skill repeatedly documents avoiding (see
 * `.claude/skills/awcms-news-portal/SKILL.md` §636 "Ketika mode TIDAK
 * aktif ... seluruh validasi baru ini adalah no-op").
 *
 * Rule catalog matches Issue #640's own "Scope" list. Five rules are
 * SECURITY blockers (`SECURITY_RULE_IDS` below) and can NEVER be downgraded
 * by tenant policy, in any environment — Issue #640's own "Security notes":
 * "Security blockers must not be downgraded by tenant policy in production."
 * This implementation is intentionally STRICTER than the letter of that
 * sentence: rather than branching on `APP_ENV` (which would mean a security
 * rule genuinely COULD be downgraded in a non-production environment, a
 * footgun for staging environments that mirror production data), overrides
 * for security rule ids are rejected unconditionally, everywhere. A stricter
 * global rule trivially satisfies a "not in production" minimum — see
 * `applyChecklistPolicyOverrides` below.
 *
 * Several rules that look independently checkable are, for a media object
 * that already reached `verified`/`attached` status, PROVABLY always true
 * by construction (Issue #634's finalize pipeline: MIME sniffing against a
 * fixed 4-type raster allow-list, and a hard byte cap during the capped
 * read) — `featured_image_mime_allowed`/`featured_image_size_within_policy`
 * below report the real recorded metadata rather than re-deriving R2
 * verification logic Issue #634 already owns; see their comments for the
 * precise reasoning. This checklist calls into the EXISTING verified-media
 * primitives (`collectGalleryImageReferences`,
 * `MediaLibraryPort.resolveMediaReferences` via the application-layer gate)
 * rather than re-deriving them, per this issue's own instruction.
