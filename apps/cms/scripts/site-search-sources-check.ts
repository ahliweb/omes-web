/**
 * site-search-sources-check.ts — `bun run site-search:sources:check`.
 *
 * ADR-0040 §3 (ported from awcms-micro Issue #270). Search-source registry
 * validation gate — same shape as `scripts/data-lifecycle-registry-check.ts` and
 * `scripts/reporting-projection-registry-check.ts`: pure code-registry
 * (`listModules()`) validation, no network, no database, safe to run on every CI
 * build.
 *
 * This gate is load-bearing beyond tidiness: `site_search`'s generic extraction
 * engine interpolates a descriptor's table/column NAMES into SQL, so an invalid
 * identifier must be caught here — before any SQL is ever built.
 *
 * ## Second phase: the reconcile job must be ALLOWED to read what it names
 *
 * Issue #625. `bun run site-search:reconcile` runs as `awcms_worker` and issues
 * one `SELECT` per descriptor against that descriptor's table. Phase one above
 * validates the descriptor's SHAPE and cannot see privileges at all, so a
 * perfectly-formed descriptor for a table the worker cannot read passes every
 * gate in this repository and then fails at 03:00 with `permission denied for
 * table <name>`, in a job nobody is watching.
 *
 * That is exactly the failure `data-lifecycle:worker-grants:check` was written
 * for on the retention side, so this reuses its scanner rather than restating a
 * list of tables that would need its own maintenance: the requirement is DERIVED
 * from the registry and checked against `sql/`.
 *
 * It reads migration TEXT, not a live database. So it proves the grant was
 * WRITTEN, not that it was APPLIED — an unapplied migration is `db:migrate`'s
 * job, and a superuser `POSTGRES_USER` making the point moot is
 * `security:readiness`'s.
