# Deployment Profiles

> **Document status:** operational target/plan, not implementation status. The `awcms` repo currently has neither ERP module code nor real `deploy/*`/`docker-compose.yml` files — this document adapts the deployment standard already proven in the `awcms-mini` base (fully implemented there) into a **target procedure** for the `awcms` ERP platform. The structure/mechanisms (environment profiles, TLS topology, two-role database model, job registry) are kept as a mandatory standard; the `awcms-mini`-specific issue/PR numbers and implementation history are removed because they are not relevant for this repo.
>
> **Correction: part of `deploy/*` ALREADY exists.** `deploy/backup/backup-postgres.sh` + `deploy/backup/restore-postgres.sh` (§Local backup), `deploy/pgbouncer/`, `deploy/cron/`, and `deploy/redis/` are real in the repo; what is still a plan is `deploy/systemd/`, `deploy/nginx/`, `deploy/postgres/`, and `docker-compose*.yml` at the repo root. Treat every file reference below according to that list, not according to the status sentence above.
>
> **Correction: `Dockerfile.production` ALREADY exists.** It is really there at the repo root (multi-stage, non-root user `bun`, healthcheck) and is already actively used by the `build` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` to build+push the image to `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms` on every release — see [`release-process.md`](release-process.md) for an accurate status description. The image-registry path (Coolify pull-image, direct `docker run`) is in this document because it is already usable today; only the LAN-first `docker-compose.yml`/systemd/nginx/pgbouncer path below is still a plan.

This document is the deployment profile standard for AWCMS (see ADR-0001, [`01_canvas_induk.md`](01_canvas_induk.md) §Final stack) — it complements the environment variable reference (`docs/awcms/18_configuration_env_reference.md`, to follow) with a concrete mapping: which file in `deploy/` and `docker-compose.yml` is used on which environment profile, once both are implemented.

The three profiles and the `deploy/*` files relevant to each (`deploy/backup/*` and `deploy/pgbouncer/*` are already real; `deploy/systemd/*`, `deploy/nginx/*`, and `docker-compose.yml` are still a plan — see the status correction above):

| **development**         | All providers off, local DB, cookies not secure                                                                                    | `bun run dev` directly (no need for `deploy/*` or `docker-compose.yml`); `.env` copied from `.env.example` as-is                                                                                                          |
| **production (online)** | HTTPS, secret manager, tested backup+restore, optional sync (e.g. Coretax/payment gateway/marketplace)                             | `deploy/systemd/awcms.service.example`, `deploy/nginx/awcms.conf.example` (TLS termination), `deploy/backup/*`, optionally `deploy/pgbouncer/*` if there are many short connections                                       |
| **offline/LAN**         | No internet; external sync/integration off or deferred; ERP operations (transactions, warehouse, HR) still run fully; local backup | `deploy/systemd/awcms.service.example` (or `docker-compose.yml`) runs the app directly on port 4321 — **nginx can be skipped entirely**, there is no public exposure; `deploy/backup/*` is still mandatory (local backup) |

**Three, not four.** `staging` used to be the fourth row of this table; it has been **removed from the profile vocabulary** ([ADR-0083](../adr/0083-this-template-deploys-to-one-environment.md), as amended) — not merely "not run here". `ModuleDeploymentProfile` in `src/modules/_shared/module-contract.ts` is therefore `development | production | offline-lan`. A profile nobody has ever drilled is a claim, not a capability: it clings to every module's `deploymentProfiles`, to every document table, and to every `APP_ENV` branch without a single deployment proving it true.

What did **not** disappear with it is its isolation contract — its own database, its own role/password, its own secrets, outbound integrations off, no writes to the production media bucket, DNS provider `manual`, per-environment purge tokens. That contract moved house to [`environments.md`](environments.md) §Second environment isolation contract, and now applies to **any second environment** someone stands up alongside their production, whatever they call it. This repo's own deployment is still just one: production at `awcms.ahlikoding.com` — what will be "staged" here is the template itself, and that is validated by the CI gate chain plus the Postgres-backed integration suite, not by a second running copy. The Coolify guide that derives this rule down to operator level: [`deploy-coolify.md`](deploy-coolify.md).

Selection principle: nginx (`deploy/nginx/`) is only needed when you need TLS termination for clients outside the trusted machine/network, or when fronting several upstream instances — a single-server LAN-first topology can serve the application directly on port 4321 with no reverse proxy at all. PgBouncer (`deploy/pgbouncer/`) is only for high-volume short-connection scenarios (e.g. many external-integration sync workers running concurrently) — not a default need.

## ERP context: offline-first is still mandatory for core operations

The LAN-first/offline-first principle that is the base standard (ADR-0001) applies equally to ERP modules: daily financial transactions, warehouse/inventory recording, HR attendance, and manufacturing processes **must keep running fully without internet** on the offline/LAN topology — only features that are inherently online-dependent (payment gateway, marketplace sync, e-Faktur/Coretax submission, online logistics tracking numbers) may be deferred/off on this profile, and they must be outboxed (ADR — outbox/queue for external integrations, see `AGENTS.md`) rather than synchronised synchronously from the critical transaction path.

## How to run each profile

### development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
bun install
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

### production (online) — bare-metal (systemd)

```bash
bun install && bun run build
sudo cp deploy/systemd/awcms.service.example /etc/systemd/system/awcms.service
sudo cp deploy/nginx/awcms.conf.example /etc/nginx/sites-available/awcms.conf
# ... adapt the placeholders in both files (see the header comments in each) ...
sudo systemctl enable --now awcms
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### offline/LAN — bare-metal (systemd, no nginx)

The same as above, minus the nginx step — LAN clients reach the application directly at `http://<lan-server-ip>:4321`.

### production / offline-LAN — container (docker-compose.yml)

The `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root (planned) will run the default LAN-first stack: `app` (image `oven/bun:1.3.14` pinned, not `node`, per the Bun-only standard) and `db` (`postgres:18.4`). PgBouncer is available as an optional `pgbouncer` service, gated by Compose `profiles` so it is never automatically active:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
export APP_UID=$(id -u) APP_GID=$(id -g)   # app runs as the host user, not root
docker compose up --build           # app + db only
docker compose --profile pgbouncer up   # include the optional pgbouncer
curl http://localhost:4321/api/v1/health
```

**Container hardening (a mandatory standard from the start, not a retrofit)**: `db` and `pgbouncer` must not publish host ports by default — only `app`'s `4321:4321` is open (the only real topological need). For local `psql`/GUI client access from the host, copy `docker-compose.override.yml.example` to `docker-compose.override.yml` (auto-loaded, `.gitignore`d) — it binds both ports to `127.0.0.1` only. Every service (`db`/`migrate`/`app`/`pgbouncer`) must run `cap_drop: [ALL]` (plus the minimal `cap_add` for `db`'s own entrypoint), `security_opt: no-new-privileges:true`, a healthcheck, and starting-point `deploy.resources.limits`. PgBouncer's `pgbouncer.ini.example` must use `auth_type = scram-sha-256` (not `md5`).

`export APP_UID/APP_GID` is mandatory — without it, `app` runs as root inside the container and `bun install`/`bun run build` write `node_modules/`/`dist/` files that persist as root-owned in the bind-mounted repo, which then blocks **host**-side `bun install`/`bun run build` on the same checkout.

All secrets/config come in through `env_file: .env` / `environment:` in `docker-compose.yml` — no hardcoded values. `DATABASE_URL` is overridden automatically by `docker-compose.yml` so it points at the `db` service hostname (not `localhost` as `.env.example` defaults to, which is meant for non-container deployments).

Compose also realises the two-role model below without a manual step: the `migrate` service (one-shot, as superuser) runs `db:migrate`, the `app` service waits for `migrate` to finish (`depends_on: … condition: service_completed_successfully`) and then connects as the least-privilege role — so `docker compose up` sequences itself: `db` init creates the roles → `migrate` applies the schema + FORCE RLS + grants → `app` starts.

### production (online) — image registry (`Dockerfile.production` + `docker-compose.prod.yml`, optional)

The `docker-compose.yml` above remains the recommended path for the single-server LAN-first topology (bind-mount + `bun install && bun run build` at container start — practical for an operator who `git pull`s/rebuilds in place). `Dockerfile.production` (used via `docker-compose.prod.yml` or a manual `docker build`/`docker run`) is **another optional** path, for image-registry-based deployment (build once in CI, push the image, pull+run identically in every environment) — used when build-at-startup is undesirable (slower cold start, you want an immutable image) or when the orchestrator (Coolify, k8s, ECS, etc.) expects a ready-made image.

Key differences vs `docker-compose.yml`'s `app` service:

| Aspect      | `docker-compose.yml` (`app`)                                  | `docker-compose.prod.yml` (`app`) / `Dockerfile.production`          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code source | Bind-mounts the repo directly (`volumes: - .:/app`)           | `COPY` into the image at build — immutable once created              |
| Build       | At container start (`bun install && bun run build`)           | At `docker build` (multi-stage) — container start is instant         |
| User        | Host user (`APP_UID`/`APP_GID`) — needs a writable bind-mount | The `oven/bun:1.3.14` image default user, `bun` (non-root, uid 1000) |
| Filesystem  | Writable (bind mount + install/build inside it)               | `read_only: true` + `tmpfs: [/tmp]`                                  |
| Migration   | A separate `migrate` service in the same compose              | Not included — run `bun run db:migrate` separately                   |
| Suited for  | LAN-first single server, operator `git pull` in place         | Registry/CI-push, container orchestrators (Coolify/k8s/ECS)          |

Two ways to run this image (planned) — pick one:

**1. `docker-compose.prod.yml` (recommended)** — a standalone stack (not an override of `docker-compose.yml`) that builds `app` from `Dockerfile.production` and runs `db` with the same hardening as `docker-compose.yml`'s `db`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
bun run db:migrate   # or a one-shot docker run, see below — run BEFORE the app starts
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
curl http://localhost:4321/api/v1/health
```

`app` here runs `read_only: true` (`tmpfs: [/tmp]`) — safe because this image does not write to its own filesystem at runtime. To deploy from an image already pushed to a registry (rather than building locally), replace the `build:` block on `app` in `docker-compose.prod.yml` with `image: <registry>/awcms:<tag>` directly.

**2. Manual `docker build`/`docker run`** — for orchestrators that do not use Compose (Coolify, k8s, ECS, etc., see [`deploy-coolify.md`](deploy-coolify.md)):

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t awcms:prod .
docker run -d --name awcms \
  -p 4321:4321 \
  --cap-drop=ALL --security-opt=no-new-privileges:true \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://awcms_app:<password>@<db-host>:5432/awcms \
  -e APP_URL=https://<fqdn> \
  -e AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true \
  -e APP_ENV=production \
  awcms:prod
curl http://localhost:4321/api/v1/health
```

`--cap-drop=ALL --security-opt=no-new-privileges:true` — a mandatory standard, and the running app needs no extra `--cap-add`.

Secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_IP_HASH_SECRET`, sync HMAC, MFA/SSO encryption keys, external integration credentials, etc.) are **always** injected at `docker run`/via the orchestrator (env var, secret store, or `--env-file`) — **never** baked into the image. `.dockerignore` excludes `.env`/`.env.*` from the build context. For orchestrators that support secret files (Docker Swarm secrets, Kubernetes Secrets as a volume mount, etc.), the `_FILE` suffix pattern is the industry-standard alternative — not yet mandatory to implement in application code; an operator who needs it can bridge at the orchestrator level (an entrypoint script that reads the secret file then `export`s a normal env var before `exec bun ...`).

This image does **not** run migrations — its runtime role (`awcms_app`, least-privilege) does not have the DDL/GRANT rights migrations need (the two-role model below). Run `bun run db:migrate` as a separate step (a CI job, or a one-shot `docker run` with a privileged `DATABASE_URL`) against a new database before this container is first started.

## TLS/trust boundaries

This application **never** terminates TLS itself (there is no HTTPS listener code) — in every topology, TLS (where present) is the responsibility of the layer **in front of** the application:

| Topology                                                                            | Where TLS stops                                                                                                       | Trust boundary                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **offline/LAN**                                                                     | No TLS — `http://` straight to port 4321                                                                              | The trust boundary = the LAN itself (trusted physical/WiFi network); no internet exposure, "PostgreSQL is not public" applies the same way to this app port |
| **production (online), bare-metal**                                                 | `deploy/nginx/awcms.conf.example` (reverse proxy TLS termination)                                                     | Public ↔ nginx = the TLS boundary; nginx ↔ app (`localhost:4321`) = plaintext HTTP **inside** the same machine, never crossing the network                  |
| **production (online), container (`docker-compose.yml`/`docker-compose.prod.yml`)** | A reverse proxy **outside** the compose stack (nginx/Caddy/Coolify's built-in proxy) — compose itself provides no TLS | Public ↔ reverse proxy = the TLS boundary **only if** the reverse proxy really is the only way in                                                           |
| **PostgreSQL (`db`)/PgBouncer**                                                     | No TLS by default (`sslmode` is not forced) — Postgres connections inside the internal Docker network                 | The trust boundary = the compose Docker network itself (`db`/`pgbouncer` publish no host ports, so they are not reachable from outside the machine at all)  |

Operational implications:

- **An important difference from `db`/`pgbouncer`**: `app`'s `ports: ["4321:4321"]` **is still bound to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) by default** in both compose files. This does **not** mean it is only reachable by the reverse proxy — on a host with a public/LAN IP that is not fully trusted, any client can contact `http://<host>:4321` directly, bypassing the TLS reverse proxy entirely. **Never** expose `app`'s port 4321 straight to the public internet without a TLS reverse proxy in front of it — `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (mandatory for the online profile) assumes the browser client really is speaking HTTPS at some point; without TLS termination, secure cookies are sent over a plaintext channel (and the first request body, such as the login password or financial transaction data, is sent in plaintext regardless of the cookie's status). This mitigation is **mandatory** at the host firewall/network level (the operator) — e.g. `ufw`/`iptables` allowing port 4321 only from `localhost`/the reverse proxy IP, not from the general internet. An operator who wants compose itself to enforce this can bind `ports: ["127.0.0.1:4321:4321"]` if the reverse proxy runs on the same machine outside Docker.
- `PUBLIC_TRUST_PROXY`/similar variables (if implemented for online-only features) are ONLY safe to set to `true` on exactly the "production (online)" row topology in this table — a TLS reverse proxy that overwrites (not appends to) `X-Forwarded-*` is a prerequisite, not optional.
- The plaintext-inside-the-Docker-network `app`↔`db`/`pgbouncer` connection is accepted as an adequate trust boundary **because** that network is never reachable from outside the machine (no host ports published by default) — if the operator runs `db` on a machine separate from `app` (a multi-server topology, outside the scope of the bundled `docker-compose.yml`/`docker-compose.prod.yml`), Postgres TLS (`sslmode=require` on `DATABASE_URL` + a Postgres server certificate) becomes the operator's responsibility.

## Secrets via deployment references

This repo's standard convention ("secrets only from the environment"): plain env vars (`${VAR:-default}` substitution in compose, `environment:`/`env_file:` in containers, or shell/systemd `EnvironmentFile=` variables on bare-metal) — **never** hardcoded into a committed file.

For orchestrators that provide their own encrypted secret-at-rest mechanism (Docker Swarm `secrets:`, Kubernetes `Secret` as a volume mount, Coolify's secret manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.), plain env vars can still be used — in practice these orchestrators inject secrets **as** runtime env vars (not files) into the container. For orchestrators that specifically mandate a **file-based** pattern (e.g. Docker Swarm secrets mounted as files at `/run/secrets/<name>`, not env vars) — an operator on this topology has two options:

1. **Bridge in the entrypoint** (recommended, no image/application code change needed): write a small entrypoint script that reads the secret files from `/run/secrets/*`, `export`s them as plain env vars, then `exec`s the original command.
2. **Plain env vars straight from the orchestrator's secret store** (simplest when the orchestrator supports it).

## Two-role database model (RLS enforcement)

Isolation between tenants/ERP entities uses PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (a mandatory standard — see AGENTS.md "PostgreSQL + RLS mandatory"). `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` alone is **not enough**: PostgreSQL bypasses RLS for the table _owner_ (unless `FORCE`) and unconditionally for SUPERUSER/BYPASSRLS roles. A deployment must therefore use two roles:

- **Migration role (privileged owner/superuser)** — runs `bun run db:migrate`. Needs DDL/GRANT rights. This is `POSTGRES_USER` in `docker-compose.yml` / the privileged URL used once for migrations.
- **Application role `awcms_app` (least-privilege)** — the role the application connects as at runtime (`DATABASE_URL` in `.env`). Not the owner, not a superuser, DML grants only; every tenant-scoped/business-entity table (ledger, payroll, inventory, etc.) must have `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` plus a fail-closed default GUC (`app.current_tenant_id` = the zero UUID → matches no tenant → 0 rows) so that RLS is genuinely enforced for this role.

Running the application as a superuser voids the entire RLS isolation — `bun run security:readiness` (to follow) must block go-live if the `DATABASE_URL` connection role turns out to be superuser/BYPASSRLS, or if any tenant/business-entity table lacks `relforcerowsecurity`. Run readiness with the application role's `DATABASE_URL`, not the migration URL.

Creating the application role:

- **Container:** automatic — `deploy/postgres/10-create-app-role.sh` (a `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` hook) creates it from `AWCMS_APP_DB_PASSWORD` at first cluster init, then the related migration grants it + FORCE RLS.
- **Bare-metal/systemd:** once at the start, as superuser — `CREATE ROLE awcms_app LOGIN PASSWORD '…';` — then `bun run db:migrate` (superuser URL). After that the app connects as `awcms_app` (`DATABASE_URL` in `.env`).

Optional additional roles (defense-in-depth), now **real** and following the same pattern — created by `sql/022_awcms_db_worker_setup_roles.sql` (Issue #163): `awcms_worker` (seven cron workers: audit purge, object/email/domain-event/workflow/reporting dispatch, `WORKER_DATABASE_URL`) and `awcms_setup` (only `POST /api/v1/setup/initialize`, `SETUP_DATABASE_URL`), each with GRANTs only for the write paths its code actually uses. Enable them opt-in once (`ALTER ROLE awcms_worker LOGIN PASSWORD '…';` then point the variable at it); both fall back to `DATABASE_URL`/`awcms_app` if unset, so the two-role model above is still the mandatory minimum foundation.

## Configuration validation before boot (`bun run config:validate`)

The mandatory configuration principle: "Configuration is validated at boot; a missing required value stops the start with a clear message." Planned: `scripts/validate-env.ts` (`bun run config:validate`).

**Config registry & deprecated vars (planned)**: `src/lib/config/registry.ts` becomes the structured source of truth for every variable (type/required/owner/sensitivity/profiles/deprecation). `bun run config:docs:check` (part of `bun run check`) keeps this registry, `.env.example`, and the configuration reference in sync.

- Must be non-empty: `APP_ENV`, `APP_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`. This list is bound to `RULES` in `scripts/validate-env.ts` by `tests/env-required-vars-doc.test.ts` — change one without the other and the gate goes red. (`APP_TIMEZONE` and `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` used to be listed here; **neither exists in awcms** — no code reads them — and they have been removed.)
- Conditional: if external sync/integration is on (`AWCMS_SYNC_ENABLED=true`), then `AWCMS_SYNC_HMAC_SECRET` must be filled in and must not be the `.env.example` placeholder (`change-me`).
- Conditional: if external object storage is on (`R2_ENABLED=true`), then the related R2 credentials must be filled in.
- Never prints the real secret values — only the names of missing/invalid variables. Non-zero exit code on any failure.

`bun run production:preflight` (planned) runs `config:validate` as its first stage, before `db:migrate` — the configuration must be valid before there is any connection/migration attempt at all.

## Scheduled dispatchers (external sync/integration, email, etc.)

The scheduled CLI dispatcher pattern (not an HTTP endpoint) is the standard for every job that depends on an external provider (email, object storage sync, payment gateway/marketplace/Coretax/logistics integration) — planned to follow the idempotent `scripts/*.ts` pattern (claim-lease `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), safe to run repeatedly, with retry/backoff and a per-provider circuit breaker. It does nothing (exit 0, no effect) when the related feature is switched off in the env — any profile that switches an integration off (e.g. offline/LAN) can safely run the dispatcher with no side effects.

External features are usually `false` in the dev `.env` — no need to schedule anything at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **offline/LAN**                      | External integrations are usually off or deferred. If enabled (e.g. a local relay), schedule as in the systemd profile below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **production (bare-metal, systemd)** | `cron` or a systemd timer separate from the main service (`awcms.service`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **container (`docker-compose.yml`)** | Run as `docker compose exec app bun run <job>` from host cron, or add a separate scheduled service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Coolify/VPS**                      | A Coolify Scheduled Task (if available) or cron on the VPS running a **one-shot container** from a repo checkout at the release tag currently running — **not** `docker exec` into the app container: `Dockerfile.production` produces a runtime-only image and does not ship `scripts/`. Full commands: [`deploy-coolify.md`](deploy-coolify.md) §Scheduled dispatchers. |

Example crontab (bare-metal/systemd, every 2 minutes — a generic pattern for the email/sync dispatchers):

```cron
*/2 * * * * cd /opt/awcms && /usr/local/bin/bun run email:dispatch >> /var/log/awcms/email-dispatch.log 2>&1
```

Example for the container topology, from host cron:

```cron
*/2 * * * * cd /opt/awcms && docker compose exec -T app bun run email:dispatch >> /var/log/awcms/email-dispatch.log 2>&1
```

Operational notes (a mandatory standard for every dispatcher that gets built):

- **Idempotent/safe to run repeatedly** — the claim-lease pattern (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) makes concurrent or overlapping invocations safe; no row is sent/processed twice (e.g. a double transaction posting, a double Coretax submission).
- **Retry/backoff must not become a spam loop**: a failed entry goes into `retry_wait` with an exponentially backed-off `next_attempt_at` before it can be claimed again.
- **The provider circuit breaker opens**: if an external provider (e.g. a payment gateway) is having an outage, the dispatcher stops claiming anything until the breaker recovers — cron still runs every tick with no effect, adding no load to a provider that is already down.
- **Multi-instance**: schedule it from **one** instance/cron entry per deployment only.

## Job registry

Every module that registers a scheduled operational command (dispatcher, retention
purge, reconciliation) declares it in `ModuleDescriptor.jobs`. **That
is the source of truth, not this document** — each entry carries `purpose`,
`recommendedSchedule`, `environmentNotes`, and `safeInOfflineLan`, and is served
directly to the operator through:

```
GET /api/v1/modules/{moduleKey}/jobs
```

This document deliberately does NOT copy that list. A previous version did, and
that copy aged exactly as predicted: it listed three ERP commands that
never existed (`finance:posting:dispatch`, `payroll:run:dispatch`,
`inventory:sync:dispatch`) while the ten jobs that actually ship went
unmentioned entirely. The only fix that lasted was to stop
copying it.

What the gates guarantee, rather than habit:

- **`modules:jobs:check`** — every script in `JOB_WORK_CLASS_REGISTRY` must have
  a `ModuleJobDescriptor` with a non-empty `recommendedSchedule`, or a
  STRUCTURAL, reasoned exception. A new worker job that forgets its descriptor
  turns CI red in the PR that adds it — it can no longer land and then never
  be scheduled by anyone.
- **`db:work-class:check`** — every script that opens a worker/setup connection must
  have a declared work class; its generator REFUSES to run when the map and disk
  disagree.

One recorded exception today: **`edge-cache:purge`**. There is no
`edge_cache` module to hang its descriptor on — the edge cache is infrastructure
in `src/lib/edge-cache/` (ADR-0043), and `ModuleDescriptor.jobs` is keyed per
module. Its schedule: **every 10–30 seconds**, tight enough that an editor's
publish shows up at the edge promptly. The full reasoning is in
`scripts/module-job-registry-check.ts`.

Every job is a pure database operation except those that explicitly touch an
external provider (when the feature is active) — `safeInOfflineLan` in each descriptor
states this per job, so the offline/LAN profile can be checked through the same
API instead of guessing from the command name.

**On-demand/manual (not recurring cron)** — run by the operator as needed:

- `security:readiness` — before go-live, and periodically (e.g. weekly) against **every** live deployment to detect drift. In this repo that means one deployment (production, [ADR-0083](../adr/0083-this-template-deploys-to-one-environment.md)); an installation running more than one environment runs it in each, with that environment's own `DATABASE_URL` — a result from one environment is never evidence for another.
- `config:validate` — before every deploy.

## Shared worker runner

`src/lib/jobs/` ALREADY exists and is genuinely used — `job-runner.ts`, `batching.ts`,
`retry-classification.ts`, and `advisory-lock.ts` are running
implementations, not a plan.

**Two concurrency models, both legitimate — pick according to the shape of the job, not according to
the migration stage.**

A previous version of this document stated that all seven dispatchers were "all built on
top of this shared runner". That was untrue for `email:dispatch` and
`sync:objects:dispatch`, and wrong in the misleading direction: the reader would
conclude that an advisory lock already prevents overlap inside the application,
when in fact the guarantee comes from the row claim — a different mechanism with different
operational properties (one of them actually ALLOWS parallel workers).

`runJob` provides:

- **An advisory lock per job name** (`pg_try_advisory_lock`, non-blocking, session-level, on a reserved connection separate from the handler) — prevents two instances of the same job from running overlapped.
- **Bounded batching per tenant/entity** (`iterateTenantsInBatches`/`runBoundedBatches`) with a safety bound (`maxPasses`).
- **Error classification** (`classifyError`): `retryable` vs `not_retryable` vs `unknown` — diagnostic, not automatic retry-with-backoff.
- **Redaction** — every error in `JobResult.error` goes through `sanitizeErrorForLog` before being printed/stored.
- **Cooperative cancellation** (SIGTERM/SIGINT-aware) with a grace period before the lock is released, so that the next tick/instance does not claim a lock that is in fact still held by a handler in the middle of a graceful shutdown.
- **Structured telemetry** (`JobResult` JSON to stdout + optional `--json-output=<path>`).

Adoption guidance for a new job:

1. Use `iterateTenantsInBatches` if the job iterates tenants/entities with bounded passes.
2. Wrap the logic into a single `runJob({ name, description, handler })` — `name` must be stable (it is used as the lock key).
3. Add `--dry-run` if the job has a sensible way to do a read-only preview without mutating (important for financial/payroll jobs — preview before the real posting).
4. Print `printJobTelemetry(result)` + `writeJobTelemetry(...)` + `applyJobExitCode(result)` at the end of `main()`.
5. External provider calls (payment gateway/marketplace/Coretax/logistics/email) STAY outside the database transaction — a handler that calls a provider must do so outside the `withTenant` transaction block, never inside one transaction together with the domain mutations.

## Local backup (all profiles)

`deploy/backup/backup-postgres.sh` and `deploy/backup/restore-postgres.sh` **really exist** in this repo (Bash, wrapping `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`) — a local backup is mandatory on **all** non-development profiles, including offline/LAN. For an ERP platform this is crucial: backup is the only recovery path for financial/inventory/payroll data when something fails.

**A backup that has been verified as restorable is a prerequisite for migration, not a routine chore alongside it.** Migrations in this repo are forward-only (there is no `down`), so the only real rollback is a restore — and a dump that has never been restore-tested is not a rollback path, it is just a file. On a single-environment topology ([ADR-0083](../adr/0083-this-template-deploys-to-one-environment.md)) that burden grows: there is no preceding environment that receives `sql/NNN` first, so this restore drill is what ADR-0083 §Consequences points to as its replacement — a mitigation, not an equivalent substitute. `restore-postgres.sh` **without** `--target` always restores into a throwaway database and then drops it, so the drill never touches the live database; the full procedure is in [`database-migrations.md`](database-migrations.md) §Step 0, and the one-shot container form for Coolify is in [`deploy-coolify.md`](deploy-coolify.md) §Backup. An installation running more than one environment must still do it per environment — one environment's dump is never the recovery path for another.

What those scripts ship today ([ADR-0123](../adr/0123-backup-encryption-manifest-authentication.md)): by default, a plain `--format=custom` dump plus a `.sha256` sidecar, and retention trimming (`BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 14) — all of it runs fully **without internet**, so the offline/LAN profile loses nothing with no secrets to manage. Where a host has a secret-management story, setting `BACKUP_AGE_RECIPIENTS_FILE` + `BACKUP_HMAC_KEY_FILE` together turns on `age` encryption-at-rest plus an HMAC-SHA256-authenticated recovery manifest (`deploy/backup/manifest.sh`); setting only one fails closed rather than silently falling back to plaintext. `deploy/backup/offsite-copy.sh` is a real retrying rsync/SSH adapter that never deletes the local copy regardless of transfer outcome, and `deploy/backup/restore-drill.sh` is a real unattended, cron/CI-capable restore drill (selects the newest eligible backup, verifies + decrypts, restores into a scratch database, records JSON-lines evidence) with no code path that can target production — see `deploy/backup/README.md` for the full operator guide.

Also shipped: `bun run resilience:dr-drill` remains a not-yet-built orchestrator (see `resilience-dr-verification.md`, whose own banner still says so) that is expected to call `restore-drill.sh` once it exists — this repo's backup/restore assurance does not block on that larger failure-injection framework.
