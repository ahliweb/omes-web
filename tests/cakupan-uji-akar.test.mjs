/**
 * Root `bun test` coverage gate: the `apps/cms` exclusion must live where it
 * cannot be stepped around.
 *
 * ## The defect is real, not hypothetical
 *
 * `apps/cms` is `ahliweb/awcms`, embedded via `git subtree`. Its suite is
 * roughly 500 files and needs a live PostgreSQL; it is meant to run under
 * its own gate (`bun run check:cms`), never under the root suite.
 *
 * That exclusion could be written as a flag inside the `test` script:
 *
 *     "test": "bun test --path-ignore-patterns='apps/cms/**'"
 *
 * That would be green on a contributor's machine and RED in CI, because
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls `bun test` BARE, not `bun run test` — the
 * flag would be silently skipped, the whole CMS suite would be collected
 * against a database CI never provisioned, and every one of those tests
 * would fail. Two commands that look alike would give two different
 * answers, and the green one is the one typed more often on a workstation.
 *
 * ## What this gate guards
 *
 * `bunfig.toml` is read by `bun test` however it is invoked. Two assertions:
 *
 *   1. `bunfig.toml` declares the exclusion.
 *   2. No script in `package.json` repeats it as a flag — two sources of
 *      truth for one rule are two sources that have to be kept in step, and
 *      one of them will eventually drift.
 *
 * What this gate does NOT see, stated so it is not mistaken for guarded: it
 * checks the DECLARATION, not the result. It does not run `bun test` itself
 * and does not count how many files actually get collected — that proof is
 * external, in each verification run's own reported file count.
