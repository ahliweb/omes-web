/**
 * docs-cleanup.mjs — the narrow, mechanical follow-on `template:init`'s own
 * removal step needs so its OWN trailing `audit:dokumen` gate (D5's "so a
 * derived repo's first commit is already green") does not immediately
 * redden on paths it just deleted.
 *
 * `bun run audit:dokumen`'s named-path check (`packages/gerbang/
 * audit-dokumen.mjs`) flags any backtick-quoted span in a markdown file
 * that names a path absent from the repo. This repository's own inherited
 * documentation (`docs/deployment.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/cms.md`,
 * `apps/storefront/README.md`, `knowledge/curated/monorepo-map.md`, and
 * others) cites `tools/seed-borneojek-mart.ts`/`tools/import-
 * seputarborneo.ts` by exact backticked path — the moment `template:init`
 * removes those files, every one of those citations goes red.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a BjekMart content purge (`docs/template.md`'s
 * own "What 'no BjekMart string left' actually means" section is explicit
 * that a full sweep is out of this tool's scope, and belongs to issue
 * #140's documentation pass). It is the mechanical minimum: for every path
 * this run ACTUALLY removed, strip the BACKTICKS around any exact citation
 * of it in a markdown file, so the citation becomes plain prose instead of
 * a path assertion the gate checks — `` `tools/seed-borneojek-mart.ts` ``
 * becomes `tools/seed-borneojek-mart.ts`. The sentence still reads (a
 * human still sees which file used to do this), it is simply no longer a
 * dead path claim.
 *
 * `apps/cms/**` is never scanned or written — the subtree embed's own
 * documentation is upstream's, not this tool's.
