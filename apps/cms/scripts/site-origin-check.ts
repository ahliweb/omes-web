/**
 * site-origin:check — no file may build an outward-facing absolute URL by
 * interpolating a request origin or by hardcoding a scheme next to a host.
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT A CODE REVIEW
 *
 * The scheme this app believes it is served over is decided by the Node
 * listener, and the listener speaks plain HTTP because Traefik terminates TLS.
 * So `url.origin` is `http://…` on an `https://…` site, and every absolute URL
 * built from it left the origin wrong. That reached production and stayed there:
 * feeds, sitemaps, JSON-LD `@id`, and share links all carried `http://`, while
 * the ONE place a human is likely to look — the canonical `<link href>` — read
 * correctly, because Cloudflare's Automatic HTTPS Rewrites patches `href`/`src`
 * attributes in flight. The defect was self-concealing at exactly the spot
 * you'd check it.
 *
 * Two shapes cause it, and both are mechanically recognisable:
 *
 *   1. `${url.origin}` — the request's own origin, interpolated into output.
 *   2. `` `https://${host}` `` — a hardcoded scheme beside a resolved host. Right
 *      in this deployment, wrong in the offline-LAN profile, and wrong the day
 *      the deployment changes.
 *
 * Both now go through `src/lib/http/site-origin.ts`, which is the only file
 * allowed to name a scheme.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT FLAG
 *
 * `new URL(x).origin` used to COMPARE (open-redirect guards, the VAPID `aud`,
 * allow-list checks) is not a producer — it never reaches output. Flagging it
 * would train readers to add ignore comments, and a gate people route around is
 * worse than no gate. So the rules match interpolation into a string, not the
 * `.origin` property itself.

 * it would be wrong. `` `https://${primaryHost}/sitemap.xml` `` is THIS site,

 *
 * The difference is what follows the closing brace: a literal domain (`.r2…`)
 * means a vendor host; `/`, a backtick, or another interpolation means the
 * interpolated value WAS the host.
 *
 * The scheme is NOT anchored to a leading backtick: the real defect included
 * `` `Sitemap: https://${input.primaryHost}/sitemap.xml` ``, where the template
 * opens with a literal prefix. `${` already guarantees a template context, so
 * the backtick added nothing but a blind spot.
