/**
 * ADR-0036 inverted media ownership: `media_library` provides the media
 * capability, and `news_portal` — which used to provide it only because the
 * registry was born inside it — is now just another consumer.
 *
 * These tests pin the parts a typecheck cannot see. A capability name is a
 * string and an import is a path, so nothing but an assertion stops either
 * drifting back. The one that matters most is `media-library-port-adapter.ts`
 * never importing `news_portal`: that single edge is what the whole extraction
 * exists to remove, and re-adding it would compile perfectly.
 *
 * This file also serves as the capability-contract-version RETIREMENT test:
 * `news_media` must be gone and `media_library` must be present.
