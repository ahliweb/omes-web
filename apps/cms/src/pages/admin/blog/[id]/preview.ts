/**
 * `GET /admin/blog/{id}/preview` (Issue #592) — what the article will look like.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * An editor wrote a body in a `<textarea>` and then GUESSED how it would appear.
 * Not a poor preview — none at all. Since #624 the body is rendered from the
 * canonical Portable Text, so what a reader sees now genuinely differs from what
 * the editing box shows: bold is bold, a link is a link, a list is a list.
 * Guessing got harder, not easier.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not in `awcms-astro`
 *
 * That repo is a static build declaring ZERO authenticated surfaces, and its own
 * suite goes red when a route leaves `output: 'static'` without saying so. Using
 * its admin-surface door would make the public template carry sessions, SSR and
 * CSP work, and PRD §45.10 still lists that as an OPEN decision. This repo
 * already has the session, the chokepoint, the audit trail, and the public
 * templates — building here reuses the whole authorization backbone instead of
 * standing up a second one.
 *
 * ## The same template, not a copy
 *
 * `renderBlogBodyHtml` + `renderPublicPageShell` — the exact functions
 * `/blog/{tenantCode}/{slug}` calls. A preview that re-implemented the template
 * would drift, and a preview that lies is worse than no preview: an editor would
 * trust it and ship the difference. `tests/blog-preview-route.test.ts` asserts
 * there is no second renderer here rather than trusting the comment.
 *
 * ## Nothing about this row is public
 *
 * The post is read through the ADMIN directory (`fetchBlogPostById`), because
 * the whole point is to see a DRAFT — the public predicate would find nothing.
 * That makes the two headers below load-bearing rather than ceremonial:
 *
 * - `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` — a crawler that reached an authenticated
 *   URL must not index the draft it found.
 * - `Cache-Control: private, no-store` — no shared cache, no disk. The same pair
 *   `theming`'s preview already carries, for the same reason.
 *
 * The route also writes NOTHING. It cannot publish, cannot touch `published_at`,
 * and adds no row to the sitemap, the feed or the search index — those are built
 * from the publication predicate, which a draft does not satisfy. The gate for
 * the whole page is `blog_content.posts.update` through `loadAdminScreen`: the
 * person who may change the article is the person who may see it unpublished.
 *
 * ## The editing overlay, and why it changes none of the above
 *
 * The second half of the issue's scope — click a block, fix it here — is
 * `src/lib/ui/blog-preview-overlay.ts`, served as a bundled module from
 * `public/`. This route contributes exactly two things to it: the renderer
 * stamps each editable block with its index in the document
 * (`editableBlockIndexes`, off everywhere else so public output is
 * byte-identical), and the body carries the canonical document as an
 * `application/json` data block for the overlay to splice into.
 *
 * The save goes to `PATCH /api/v1/blog/posts/{id}` — the endpoint the editor
 * screen already uses, with its own authorization, its own validation and its
 * own revision and cache-purge behaviour. So this file still writes nothing,
 * and there is still no second authorization path: a principal who reaches this
 * page holds `posts.update`, and the API asks again anyway.
 *
 * The overlay is offered ONLY when the canonical body is what got rendered.
 * See `editable` below.
