# Management Reporting

Implementation of Issue 9.1 (`docs/awcms/06_github_issues_detail.md` §Issue 9.1 — Add Management Reporting Views).

## Scope

Five **generic** reporting views (a derived application adds its own domain views on top of this base):

1. **Tenant activity summary** (`GET /api/v1/reports/tenant-activity`) — the tenant's name/status/creation date, the number of active tenant users (`awcms_tenant_users` — it has no `deleted_at` column, so it is only filtered by `status = 'active'`), the number of active offices (`awcms_offices`, `status = 'active' AND deleted_at IS NULL`), and the last login time across the tenant (`MAX(awcms_identities.last_login_at)`).
2. **Access/audit summary** (`GET /api/v1/reports/access-audit`) — the number of `allow`/`deny` ABAC decisions in the last 30 days plus the all-time total count from `awcms_abac_decision_logs`, and the total number of `awcms_profile_audit_logs` entries as a generic proxy for "there is other audit activity" (this base does not yet have a general `audit_events` table — see `src/modules/sync-storage/README.md` §Not yet available).
3. **Sync health** (`GET /api/v1/reports/sync-health`) — the total/active sync node counts and the last push/pull times (`awcms_sync_nodes`), the number of `open` conflicts (`awcms_sync_conflicts`), and the number of `pending`/`failed` objects (`awcms_object_sync_queue`). The response adds the derived flags `hasOpenConflicts`, `hasFailedObjects`, `isHealthy` (`activeNodeCount > 0` and no open conflicts/failed objects) — see `domain/sync-health.ts` (`shapeSyncHealth`, a pure function, unit-tested separately from I/O).
4. **Module usage** (`GET /api/v1/reports/module-usage`) — for every module registered in `src/modules/index.ts`, one generic "there is data" signal: `tenant_admin` → office count, `profile_identity` → profile count, `identity_access` → identity count, `sync_storage` → sync node count, `reporting` itself → the row count of `awcms_permissions` (a **global** catalogue, not tenant-scoped — unlike the other metrics). A module this function does not recognise gets `metricLabel: "No metric defined yet"` instead of an error, so that it stays generic towards new modules in the future.
5. **Email queue health** (`GET /api/v1/reports/email-health`, Issue #499) — the health of the `email_messages`/`_delivery_attempts` queue: the message count per status (`queued`/`sending`/`sent`/`failed`/`cancelled`), the most recent failed messages, and the retry backlog (`application/email-health-report.ts`'s `fetchEmailHealthReport`). It adds a dependency on the `email` module to the `dependencies` array (`module.ts`).

**No new tables.** All five views are live read-aggregations over tables already created by migrations 002-009 and `020`-`021` (email). Migration `010_awcms_management_reporting_permission_schema.sql` only adds **one** permission (`reporting.dashboard.read`) to the global `awcms_permissions` catalogue — enough for all five views (one dashboard feature, deliberately not split into a permission per view, including when `email-health` was added in #499).

## Guard

All five endpoints use a pattern identical to `GET /api/v1/sync/conflicts` and `POST /api/v1/access/evaluate`: bearer session (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` + the `X-AWCMS-Tenant-ID` header), `resolveTenantContext` + `fetchGrantedPermissionKeys` + `evaluateAccess` (default deny) + `recordDecisionLog` (recorded for every call, allow as well as deny), gated by `{ moduleKey: "reporting", activityCode: "dashboard", action: "read" }`. Access denied → `403 ACCESS_DENIED`, not silently empty data.

## Dashboard SSR (`/admin`)

`src/pages/admin/index.astro` (which was previously a "Dashboard not yet available — see Issue 9.1" placeholder since Issue 8.1) now SSR-fetches the four aggregations **directly** through `withTenant` + the `application/*-report.ts` functions in this module — not an HTTP round-trip to the application's own `/reports/*` endpoints (that would be redundant; the endpoints stay for the API contract/other clients). If `Astro.locals.ssrContext.permissions` does not contain `reporting.dashboard.read`, the page renders an "Access denied" panel (not an empty card, not a 500).

## SyncIndicator

`src/layouts/AdminLayout.astro` uses `application/sync-indicator.ts` (`fetchSyncIndicatorActive`) for the topbar `<SyncIndicator active={...} />` — this is not a re-run of the full `GET /reports/sync-health` aggregation but a single lightweight `EXISTS` query (this layout renders on every `/admin/*` request), with the same "healthy" formula: at least one active node, no open conflicts, no failed objects.

## Projections (Issue #753, epic `platform-evolution` #738 Wave 3)

Extension to this module (not a new module): module-contributed
read-model projection descriptors, incremental cursor/domain-event
updates, idempotent rebuild, freshness/staleness signals, source
reconciliation, and scheduled exports. Full design rationale lives as
dense header comments in the source files below — this section is a
map, not a duplicate.

### The descriptor contract (`ProjectionDescriptor`)

Defined in `src/modules/_shared/module-contract.ts` (same "module
declares its own array, a central aggregator reads `listModules()`"
shape `dataLifecycle`/`sodRules` already established). A module
contributes ONE entry per projection in its own `module.ts`'s
`reportingProjections` array — `reporting`'s own three entries
(`module.ts`) are the only ones registered in this PR. `reporting`'s
engine never writes another module's transactional table; it only ever
reads a source table (via a bounded cursor re-scan, or a `domain_event`
consumer) and writes its own `awcms_reporting_projection_*` tables.

Registry validation: `domain/projection-registry.ts`'s
`validateProjectionRegistry`, wired into `bun run check` via `bun run
reporting:projections:registry:check`.

### Two update strategies

- **`cursor_table`** — a bounded, cursor-ordered poll of one or more
  source tables (`ProjectionCursorStream`), incrementing/decrementing
  named metric counters via row-matching rules. This is the ONLY safe
  strategy for a table with no domain-event producer yet — but it is
  only CORRECT for a genuinely append-only source (no hard delete, no
  soft-delete-then-restore): the engine can only ever ADD, so a source
  row that later disappears or gets un-deleted would silently desync
  the count. This is why `access_audit_summary` (ABAC decision log,
  truly append-only) and `module_activity_summary` (identities/sync
  nodes, no delete mechanism at all in this base) were chosen to wrap —
  NOT `sync-health`/`email-health`/office-and-profile counts from
  `module-usage`, which are mutable-state or soft-delete-with-restore
  and would need row-level CDC/delta tracking to project safely
  (a legitimate, larger follow-up, not attempted here).
- **`domain_event`** — steady-state updates are PUSHED by a registered
  `domain_event_runtime` consumer (Issue #742), reusing that module's
  shared jobs/locks/batching/idempotency/retry/pause-resume machinery
  instead of building a second one. The ONE real (non-reference) new
  consumer this issue registers lives in `domain-event-runtime/
infrastructure/consumer-registry.ts` (`reporting.event_activity_
projector`) — the one deliberate cross-module edge, one-directional
  (`domain_event_runtime -> reporting/application`), verified cycle-free
  by `tests/module-boundary.test.ts`.

Every projection — REGARDLESS of its steady-state strategy — is
REBUILT via the exact same bounded `cursor_table` re-scan mechanism
(`rebuildSource`, always present), reading the authoritative source
table directly (for `event_activity_summary`, that's
`awcms_domain_events` itself, never by re-triggering delivery).

### Dimensional projections (Issue #117 — `commerce`'s sales reports)

The scalar `metrics` rules can only COUNT rows. A projection whose read
model is per-day/per-product/per-category money and quantity figures
declares, on each of its cursor streams, a `dimensional` sink
(`ProjectionDimensionalSink`: extra `selectColumns` + an `applyBatch`
function) and, on the descriptor, a `dimensional` contract
(`ProjectionDimensionalContract`: `resetForTenant`, `readProjectionTotals`,
`computeSourceTotals`, `exportRows`) — `_shared/module-contract.ts`,
`MODULE_CONTRACT_VERSION` 4.2.0. This engine stays generic: it hands the
sink every fetched batch (incremental worker AND rebuild pass) inside the
same bounded transaction, after the advisory lock and before the cursor
advance; calls `resetForTenant` from the rebuild reset in the same
transaction as the cursor/metric reset; merges the two dimensional
control-total sets into reconciliation's detail rows; and, on export,
writes the dimensional rows (`writeLocalTabularExportArtifact`) instead of
the metric snapshot. It never learns the target table's name or shape —
the owning module writes its own tables through the engine's `tx`. The
registry gate refuses a sink without the contract and vice versa. The only
registered instance today is `commerce`'s three `commerce.sales_*`
projections (`commerce/application/sales-report-projection.ts`).

### Idempotent rebuild — the correctness-critical part

`application/projection-rebuild.ts`'s own header comment is the primary
reference; summary:

1. `triggerOrResumeRebuild` is the ONLY place cursors/metrics reset to
   zero — done in the CALLER's own transaction (the API route's), atomic
   with the new run row, audit log, and idempotency record. Migration
   069's partial unique index (`... WHERE status = 'running'`) makes a
   concurrent double-reset impossible at the database level;
   `createRebuildRun` uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (never a
   raw unique-violation exception) so a lost race doesn't poison the
   transaction.
2. `continueRebuildPasses` NEVER resets anything — only ever advances an
   already-`'running'` run's cursor forward, one bounded pass = one
   transaction (select batch -> apply deltas -> advance cursor -> bump
   `rows_processed`), the same crash-safe shape `data_lifecycle`'s
   archive/purge engine already proved. A crash between passes leaves
   cursor/metrics/`rows_processed` consistent at exactly the last
   COMPLETED pass; resuming (a retried API call, the next scheduled
   `reporting:projections:refresh` tick, or a re-triggered rebuild that
   finds one already `'running'`) picks up exactly there — never
   double-counts, never skips.
3. While a rebuild owns a (tenant, projection), the `cursor_table`
   steady-state worker SKIPS it entirely (no-op, not an error) — the
   rebuild's own full re-scan shares the SAME cursor, so it is guaranteed
   to already cover any row written during its window. The `domain_event`
   live consumer instead THROWS (deferring via the normal retry/backoff
   path) and, on retry, compares the event's own `occurredAt` against the
   rebuild-source stream's cursor WATERMARK to tell "already counted by a
   rebuild that has since completed/cancelled/failed" apart from "never
   counted by anything" — a plain skip-with-blind-retry would either
   permanently lose an event (if the blocking rebuild was cancelled
   before reaching it) or double-count it (if the rebuild went on to
   complete normally); see `application/event-activity-projection.ts`'s
   own header comment for the full analysis (security-auditor finding,
   PR #781).

Mutual exclusion between a rebuild and the steady-state incremental path
rests on a per-(tenant, projection) `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
(`application/projection-lock.ts`) taken as the first statement of every
transaction that writes a projection's cursor/metric rows — read that
file's header before touching any of them (Issue #151). It is covered by
`tests/reporting-projection-rebuild-lock.test.ts`, which runs against a
real PostgreSQL and skips cleanly when `REPORTING_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is
unset.

Not yet ported from awcms-mini: that repo's adversarial test (bounded
pass -> simulated crash -> resumed continuation -> exact correct total)
and its `provisionWorkerRole()`-based least-privilege test. This
repository has no `tests/integration/` suite for them to live in yet.

### Freshness — computed live, never cached

`domain/freshness.ts`'s `computeProjectionFreshness` is a PURE function
of raw persisted facts (`last_success_at`, `consecutive_failures`) vs.
`now` — never a stored status enum. If the worker that's supposed to
keep a projection fresh stops running ENTIRELY, no write ever happens
again, but the READ path still correctly ages the reported status from
`current` -> `delayed` -> `stale` purely from elapsed time. Five states:
`current` / `delayed` / `stale` / `rebuilding` (always wins) / `failed`
(consecutive-failure threshold, checked after `rebuilding`).

### Reconciliation

`application/projection-reconciliation.ts`'s `reconcileProjection`
computes a FRESH, full control total straight from the same
`rebuildSource` contract and compares it to the live projection
metrics — on-demand only (`POST /api/v1/reports/projections/{key}/
reconcile`), no `Idempotency-Key` (zero mutation of business state,
only appends a history row, same posture `data_lifecycle`'s dry-run
endpoint already established). A mismatch while a projection is merely
`delayed` is EXPECTED, not a bug — read freshness alongside reconcile,
never instead of it.

### Scheduled exports

Minimal, self-contained (not built on Issue #752 `data_exchange`, which
was still in parallel development when this issue shipped — its
staged-import/large-dataset machinery is the right fit for arbitrary
business-record export, not this projection's small metric-snapshot
export). `application/export-generation.ts` writes a CSV/JSON snapshot
(one row per metric) to `REPORTING_EXPORT_ROOT_PATH` (doc 18,
`infrastructure/local-export-adapter.ts`, SHA-256 checksummed, CSV
formula-injection neutralized) OUTSIDE any DB transaction, then records
one `awcms_reporting_export_runs` manifest row (checksum, row
count, expiry). `bun run reporting:exports:dispatch` reuses the exact
same generation function for every enabled, due
`awcms_reporting_scheduled_exports` config. Download
(`GET /api/v1/reports/exports/runs/{id}/download`) re-checks RBAC/ABAC
and tenant scope at DOWNLOAD time and refuses an expired artifact with
`410 Gone`. The returned `X-Checksum-Sha256` header is the manifest's
stored value, not recomputed from the bytes actually read at download
time (a minor defense-in-depth gap — on-disk tampering detection, not
the primary access control, which stays ABAC+RLS — noted here rather
than silently assumed, security-auditor finding PR #781).

**`filter` is accepted/persisted but not yet applied** — `POST
/api/v1/reports/exports`'s `filter` field is stored on the scheduled
export config and returned by every read, but `generateProjectionExport`
never consults it: every export always contains the full metric
snapshot. Rather than silently ignore a submitted filter (a false sense
of scoping), the create endpoint rejects a non-empty `filter` with `400
NOT_IMPLEMENTED` until a follow-up issue defines its schema and wires it
into generation (reviewer + security-auditor finding, PR #781).

### API

`GET /api/v1/reports/projections[/{key}]`,
`POST .../projections/{key}/rebuild[/cancel]`,
`POST .../projections/{key}/reconcile`,
`GET/POST /api/v1/reports/exports`, `POST .../exports/{id}/disable`,
`POST .../exports/trigger`, `GET .../exports/runs`,
`GET .../exports/runs/{id}/download` — see
`openapi/modules/reporting.openapi.yaml`. Every mutation
(`rebuild`, `rebuild/cancel`, `exports` create/disable/trigger) requires
`Idempotency-Key`; `reconcile` and every `GET` do not (no business-state
mutation).

### Permissions

Additive to the pre-existing `reporting.dashboard.read` (migration 010,
unchanged): `reporting.projections.{read,rebuild,analyze}`,
`reporting.exports.{read,configure,export}` (migration 070,
`domain/projection-permissions.ts`'s `REPORTING_PROJECTION_PERMISSIONS`
single source of truth).

**Two enforcement layers for reading a projection** (list/get-detail/
reconcile): the route's own coarse `authorizeInTransaction` gate
(`reporting.projections.read`/`.analyze`) is necessary but NOT
sufficient — every descriptor also declares its OWN
`ProjectionDescriptor.requiredPermission`, additionally enforced by
`domain/projection-permission-filter.ts` (filters the list, 403s a
single-key lookup) — same pattern
`module-management/domain/navigation-registry.ts`'s
`filterVisibleNavigationEntries` already established for admin nav. All
three descriptors registered in this PR happen to share the same
`requiredPermission`, so this second layer is not yet distinguishable
from the first for any REAL descriptor today — but it is what stops a
caller holding only the coarse permission from seeing a FUTURE
narrower-permissioned projection a derived module registers (reviewer
finding, PR #781).

### Admin UI

`/admin/reporting` (`src/pages/admin/reporting.astro`, ADR-0051) — the
projection cards with live freshness status, metric values and the most
recent reconciliation; rebuild / cancel-rebuild / reconcile actions;
rebuild history; scheduled-export management (create, disable) and
on-demand trigger; export-run history with checksum-verified download
links. It also renders `email-health`, the one dashboard view `/admin`
never picked up.

Every mutation goes through the real `/api/v1/reports/*` endpoints — no
privileged shortcut, no SQL in the page. Five of them send a fresh
per-click `Idempotency-Key`; `reconcile` sends none, because that
endpoint mutates no business state and requires none.

## Not yet available

- **No worker, materialized view, or caching layer** for the FIVE live endpoints above — these endpoints deliberately remain live aggregation on every request, unchanged by §Projections below. For a tenant with a large data volume (many sync nodes/decision logs), dashboard latency will track the cost of the direct query; optimisation (a scheduled materialized view, a cache, and so on) is deliberately **out of scope** for this issue 9.1. Issue #753 (§Projections below) adds a NEW and SEPARATE path (read-model projection + worker + freshness) that wraps PART of two of these endpoints (access-audit, module-usage) without changing the live endpoints themselves — both stay available side by side, neither replaces the other.
- No pagination/custom date filter on `access-audit` — the 30-day window is currently hardcoded (`ACCESS_AUDIT_DECISION_WINDOW_DAYS`).
- A derived domain module (e.g. AWPOS) adds its own domain reporting views (sales, stock, tax) in a separate module, not in this generic module.
- `GET /api/v1/reports/email-health` (#5 above) is still **not** on the SSR dashboard (`src/pages/admin/index.astro`) — the admin dashboard still shows the first four views (tenant activity, access/audit, sync health, module usage). Since ADR-0051 this fifth view is rendered at `/admin/reporting` (§Admin UI above), so it is no longer API-only; moving/duplicating it into an `/admin` card is deliberately not done — one view, one place.
