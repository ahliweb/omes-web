 * `POST /api/v1/auth/register` (Wave 2 delta auth, adapted from awcms-micro).
 *
 * Records a request for review. It NEVER creates an account, never accepts a
 * role or any other privilege field, and never accepts a password — approval
 * creates the account with an unusable credential and emails a claim link (see
 * `application/self-registration.ts`).
 *
 * ## Off by default, and invisibly so
 *
 * `AUTH_SELF_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` gates it, and a disabled deployment answers
 * `404 NOT_FOUND` — the same answer a route that does not exist gives, so the
 * switch is not discoverable by probing.
 *
 * ## Enumeration-safe
 *
 * An address that already has an account, an address with a request already
 * pending, an inactive tenant, and a freshly recorded request all return the
 * identical 200. "This address is already registered" is the single most useful
 * sentence an attacker could be given here, which is exactly why it is never
 * said. The audit event records which it was.
