/**
 * `form_drafts` — ported from awcms-micro (Issue #484), the first Gelombang-1
 * row of `docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md`.
 *
 * Net-new and additive: no existing module changes behaviour, the module DAG
 * stays acyclic (this depends only on `identity_access`), and no other module's
 * wizard writes to it yet. It is infrastructure a later multi-step form reaches
 * for, not a tenant-facing feature on its own.
 *
 * It nonetheless declares `navigation` now. The screen it points at,
 * `/admin/form-drafts`, is an OPS/JANITOR view — filter, inspect the payload
 * read-only, delete — NOT an authoring UI, so it is useful before any wizard
 * exists: without it the drafts a tenant accumulates are invisible outside the
 * JSON API, and the only way to clear a stuck one is the daily purge job. The
 * entry is gated on `form_drafts.draft.read`, the same triple the routes
 * enforce and `sql/063` seeds; a non-core entry without a
 * `requiredPermission` would be visible to everyone (and fails
 * `tests/admin-navigation-registry.test.ts`). No `group` is set — `form_drafts`
 * already has a `DEFAULT_MODULE_TYPE` placement (`system`), which wins.
 *
 * `type: "system"` — like `logging`/`data_lifecycle`, this is shared platform
 * mechanism rather than a business capability. A derived or website module owns
 * what a draft's payload MEANS; this module only owns that it is stored,
 * bounded, resumable, and eventually purged.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT ported alongside it: awcms-micro's wizard COMPONENT library
 * (`WizardStepper`/`WizardPanel`/`WizardActions`, `wizard-client.ts`). That is
 * the `src/components/ui/` Gelombang-0 row, still open, and this store is
 * usable without it — the API is what a wizard talks to, not the other way
 * round.
