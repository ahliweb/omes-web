/**
 * Retention/purge for `awcms_audit_events` (Issue #146). Ported from
 * awcms-mini's own `logging/application/audit-purge.ts`.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` was already documented (`.env.example:4`, doc
 * 18) and already validated as an integer >= 1
 * (`scripts/validate-env.ts`) — but NOTHING read it. An operator who set it
 * got a silently no-op retention policy while `awcms_audit_events` grew
 * without bound. A validated env var that does nothing is worse than an
 * absent one: it buys false confidence. This module is the missing
 * implementation.
 *
 * 730 days (2 years) is the default: doc 04 §Retention awal names the policy
 * only in prose ("Security/audit log: 1-5 tahun sesuai kebutuhan"), and 730
 * is the midpoint of that range — long enough for a full annual audit/tax
 * cycle, short enough that an append-only table doesn't grow forever on a
 * long-lived tenant. Overridable per run via `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`
 * (doc 18) or `--retention-days=<n>`.
 *
 * ## Legal hold enforcement (ADR-0037)
 *
 * `logging.audit_events` is this module's registered "delegated" adopter
 * (`src/modules/logging/module.ts`'s `dataLifecycle` descriptor,
 * `executionMode: "delegated"`) — the `data_lifecycle` module's own engine
 * NEVER mutates this table, it only reports a dry-run snapshot, so THIS function
 * is the only real enforcement point for "an active legal hold on
 * `logging.audit_events` overrides ordinary retention and cannot be silently
 * bypassed". Before deleting, this asks the caller-supplied `legalHoldGuard`
 * (a `LegalHoldGuardPort`, see `_shared/ports/legal-hold-guard-port.ts`) whether
 * this exact descriptor key is held — if so, the whole batch is skipped
 * (`purgedCount: 0`) rather than deleting anything. The parameter is REQUIRED
 * (not optional/defaulted) so no call site can silently skip the check. Not
 * imported directly from `data_lifecycle`'s `application`/`domain` code — that
 * would create a forbidden circular cross-module import (ADR-0011); the port is
 * the documented way around it, wired at the composition root
 * (`scripts/audit-log-purge.ts`).
 *
 * ## Scope: this purges `awcms_audit_events` ONLY
 *
 * `awcms_abac_decision_logs` (one row per authorized request — ~8.6M
 * rows/day at 100 req/s) is NOT touched here. It is the larger volume
 * problem, but it is a different problem: mini does not purge it either
 * (there it is a projection cursor source), and deleting from it needs a
 * retention decision this issue never made. Deliberately left to its own
 * issue rather than quietly bundled in — see the report on #146.

 * Deletes ONE batch (up to `batchLimit`) of one tenant's
 * `awcms_audit_events` rows older than the retention cutoff and — unless the
 * batch was empty — records the purge itself as a new audit event in the
 * SAME transaction (doc 04 §Aturan implementasi: "Purge ... harus diaudit" —
 * never a silent purge). The recorded `attributes` carry only counts and the
 * cutoff, never which individual rows were deleted; there is nothing
 * sensitive to redact there, and `recordAuditEvent` redacts defensively
 * anyway.
 *
 * Self-auditing means a purge run is never a no-op even when it deletes
 * everything past the cutoff: the newest row it writes (its own purge event)
 * is by construction newer than the cutoff, so it survives the same run and
 * the next one. The table can therefore never be emptied to "no evidence a
 * purge happened".
 *
 * Callers loop this per tenant until it returns `purgedCount: 0` (see
 * `scripts/audit-log-purge.ts`, via `iterateTenantsInBatches`) — so one huge
 * backlog can neither hold a single DB transaction open indefinitely nor
 * make a scheduled run non-terminating.
 *
 * Age-only cutoff, no cascading delete: `awcms_audit_events` (migration 007)
 * has no dependent FK children, so a physical DELETE here cannot "memutus FK
 * penting" (doc 04).
