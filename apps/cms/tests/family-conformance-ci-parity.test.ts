/**
 * Parity test (Issue #183, epic #177, ADR-0032) — the conformance step must
 * not silently drop out of `bun run check` OR the CI/release workflows, and the
 * DB-gated fail-closed contract test must stay wired into the dedicated
 * DB-suite steps of both pipelines.
 *
 * This is the guard ADR-0015 §6 documents the need for (PR #770 lesson: a new
 * `bun run X:check` was added to package.json's `check` but never to
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s manually-listed steps, so it silently never ran
 * in CI). No DB, no network — plain file reads.
