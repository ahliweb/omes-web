/**
 * `POST /api/v1/omes/worker/result` ingestion (ahliweb/omes#199).
 *
 * Correlated by `(tenant_id, server_id, idempotency_key)` — NOT the wire
 * `job_id`, which `worker-result.request.schema.json` requires but is the
 * WORKER's own local job-store id (see `sql/159`'s header for why: the
 * `operation-request` schema a poll response's `job` object must conform to
 * has no `job_id` property at all). `idempotency_key` is the one identifier
 * both sides agree on — AWCMS minted it at job-promotion time and handed it
 * to the worker in the poll response; the worker echoes it back unchanged.
 *
 * Idempotent by the same `(tenant_id, server_id, idempotency_key)` via a
 * single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id` — same
 * rows-returned-decides pattern as `worker-nonce-store.ts` and the shared
 * idempotency store, for the same reason (this driver's SQLSTATE is on
 * `error.errno`, not `error.code`, so catching "23505" is dead code).
 *
 * ## Bound to the LEASING worker, not just tenant+server+key (CONFIRMED
 * MEDIUM, independent review of PR #823)
 *
 * `sql/154` makes `worker_id` unique only per `(tenant_id, worker_id)` —
 * `server_id` is NOT part of that uniqueness, so two enrolled workers can
 * legitimately point at the same `server_id` (a key-rotation window, or two
 * worker processes on one host). Correlating a result by
 * `(tenant_id, server_id, idempotency_key)` alone — the envelope-verified
 * scope, which does correctly stop cross-TENANT substitution — would still
 * let any co-enrolled worker for that `(tenant, server)` submit a
 * correctly-signed result for a job it never leased, as long as it knows
 * (or guesses) the `idempotency_key`. Every read and write here additionally
 * requires `leased_by = ` the verified worker identity: a non-leasing
 * worker gets the same `unknown_job` outcome as a nonexistent job — never
 * distinguished, so this is not a new oracle.
 *
 * A 2xx from this endpoint is NEVER "the job succeeded". Every row this
 * writes is stamped `source = 'worker_reported'` / `reconciled = false` at
 * the schema level (sql/159's CHECK + DEFAULT) — this file never sets
 * `reconciled = true`, because nothing in this issue's scope independently
 * confirms host state. `awcms_omes_jobs.state`/`.result` ARE updated (that
 * table is this module's operational queue bookkeeping — cancel/retry logic
 * in #198's `job-directory.ts` depends on jobs reaching a terminal state),
 * but the redacted evidence that lands in the audit projection explicitly
 * carries `source: "worker_reported"` and `reconciled: false` so no report
 * or admin screen reading `awcms_omes_audit_projections` can present a
 * worker's self-report as confirmed success.
