/**
 * Makes the migration-017/019 verification PERMANENT (Issue #154, pinning
 * PR #139's "RLS inert on 23 tables" finding and Issue #141's least-privilege
 * `awcms_app` role).
 *
 * #139 was verified ONCE, by hand: run every migration in a throwaway
 * database under a non-superuser owner, seed two tenants, read tenant B's
 * rows with the GUC set to tenant A, observe the leak before `FORCE` and its
 * absence after. That procedure is exactly what belongs in a permanent test
 * rather than in a commit message — which is what this file is.
 *
 * TWO POSTURES, BOTH REAL, BOTH TESTED. Migration 019 ships `awcms_app`
 * `NOLOGIN`, and `getNamedDatabaseClient` falls back to `DATABASE_URL`, so a
 * deployment that has not explicitly activated the role still connects as the
 * migration OWNER. Both are therefore live production shapes and both are
 * covered here:
 *
 *   - OWNER (`getOwnerSql()`)  — `FORCE` (migration 017) is the ONLY thing
 *     stopping cross-tenant reads. Without it, `ENABLE` is inert and every
 *     policy is skipped. This is the #139 regression's exact habitat.
 *   - APP (`getAppRoleSql()`)  — non-owner, so RLS applies regardless of
 *     `FORCE`; what is being pinned here is #141's grant matrix and the
 *     fail-closed all-zero `app.current_tenant_id` default. A DEDICATED
 *     `awcms_app` connection this harness owns, never the process-wide
 *     `getDatabaseClient()` pool (which a full `bun test` run pins to a
 *     different database entirely — see harness.ts).
 *
 * THE CONTROL TEST is `awcms_tenants`, which deliberately has no RLS (it is
 * the root table every tenant-scoped policy resolves against). It stays
 * visible cross-tenant, which proves that every "0 rows" result below is RLS
 * doing its job rather than a broken connection or a missing grant — without
 * it, a harness bug that silently pointed at an empty database would make
 * this whole file pass.
 *
 * `awcms_app` assertions SKIP — loudly — if migration 019 is absent, rather
 * than hard-failing a run on work that has not landed.
 *
 * Skipped entirely unless `DATABASE_URL` is set (see harness.ts §Gating).
