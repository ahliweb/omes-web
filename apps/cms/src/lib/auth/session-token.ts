 * thing that survives hashing to tell it what it is holding.
 *
 * The dispatch lives here rather than at the call sites because 183 route files
 * already call this function between `resolveAuthInputs` and
 * `authorizeInTransaction`. Tagging the hash means the guard chokepoint can
 * tell the two kinds apart from the hash ALONE — one lookup per request, in the
 * right table, with no signature change rippling through those 183 files and no
 * chance of one kind being searched in the other's namespace.
 *
 * The name is kept for the same reason: renaming it would be exactly the
