/**
 * blog-ads-drop-readiness.ts — `bun run blog:ads:drop-readiness`.
 *
 * ADR-0044 §4 Fase 2, step three: answers "may `awcms_blog_ads` and
 * `awcms_blog_ad_placements` be dropped yet?" from the data, and exits non-zero
 * while the answer is no.
 *
 * The drop migration is irreversible and takes a live site's advertising with
 * it. Every other safeguard in this epic is about not losing rows silently, and
 * they all become decorative if the final step is taken on the strength of
 * someone remembering they ran the ingest. Migration 079's
 * `source_legacy_ad_id` exists so this can be a join instead: run this, read
 * the number, and only then write the drop.
 *
 * A legacy ad is accounted for when a successor row names it, OR when it is
 * soft-deleted — an operator read the residue report and decided it does not
 * come along. Anything else blocks. There is deliberately no override flag: a
 * check that can be told to pass is a check nobody has to satisfy.
 *
 * Read-only. It issues no UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE, so it is safe to run
 * against production at any time, including before the ingest has ever run.
 *
 * Runs as the least-privilege `awcms_worker` role, which holds SELECT on both
 * legacy tables and the successor (`sql/079`) and nothing more. RLS is FORCE'd
 * for that role too, so every pass is wrapped in `withTenantOrThrow`.
