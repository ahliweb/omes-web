/**
 * `defineTenantRoute` runs the opening in order and short-circuits at every
 * point a hand-written route does.
 *
 * ## Why there are no module mocks here
 *
 * The first version of this file mocked `tenant-context`, `client`,
 * `session-token` and `access-guard` through `mock.module`, and restored them
 * with `mock.restore()`. It passed locally and turned CI red in twelve places:
 * `mock.restore()` does NOT undo `mock.module`, so the fake `withTenant` leaked
 * into every later file in the process. `tests/tenant-context-circuit-breaker.
 * test.ts` asked for a 503 and got the fake's 200.
 *
 * It passed locally only because `tenant-context-circuit-breaker` sorts before
 * `tenant-route-factory` on this filesystem and had already run. That is luck,
 * not isolation — and a test whose correctness depends on readdir order is not
 * a test.
 *
 * So: real modules throughout, following awcms-micro's own factory test. The
 * circuit breaker is forced OPEN, which makes `withTenant` return its 503
 * before it ever calls `sql.begin` — every assertion below therefore exercises
 * the genuine `withTenant`, the genuine `resolveAuthInputs`, and the genuine
 * pool gate, and no connection is ever opened.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT cover
 *
 * The allowed path — handler running inside a real transaction with a resolved
 * `auth.context`. That needs a session row, a permission grant and a database;
 * faking it is what produced the leak above. It belongs in the DB-gated suite,
 * and the four migrated `/api/v1/reports/*` routes are covered there through
 * their own endpoints.
