/**
 * `/admin/theming` gates against the endpoints it drives.
 *
 * Sibling of `admin-security-page-contract.test.ts` and
 * `admin-site-search-page-contract.test.ts`, for the same silent failure: a page
 * that gates on a permission key NO migration seeds hides the section from
 * everyone — including the owner — and still looks like a working screen with an
 * empty area. This repo has shipped that bug twice, both times by inventing a
 * plausible action name.
 *
 * `theming` is a high-risk place to repeat it. Its six permissions span three
 * activity codes (`config`, `version`, `preview`) and FOUR non-CRUD actions
 * (`publish`, `restore`, `archive`, `create`), and the screen's own vocabulary
 * disagrees with the permission's: the button says "Roll back" but the seeded
 * action is `restore`, the button says "Retire" but the action is `archive`.
 * `theming.version.rollback` / `theming.version.retire` / `theming.config.publish`
 * each read perfectly and would deny everyone.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
