/**
 * `/admin/security` gates against the endpoints it drives.
 *
 * The screen renders nothing that its own permission checks do not allow, but
 * those checks are UX only — the endpoints are the authority. The failure this
 * pins is the opposite one, and it is silent: a page that gates on a permission
 * key NO migration seeds hides the section from everyone, including the owner,
 * and looks like a working screen with an empty area. This repo has shipped
 * that bug twice (admin roles write, admin ABAC policy write), both times by
 * inventing a plausible action name.
 *
 * So: extract the guard triples from the route sources, extract the
 * `permissionKey(...)` triples from the page, and require the page's set to be
 * a subset of what the routes actually enforce AND of what the module
 * descriptor declares (which `module-management`'s permission sync compares
 * against the seed migrations).
