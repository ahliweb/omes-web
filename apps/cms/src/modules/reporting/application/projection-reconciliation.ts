/**
 * Source reconciliation (Issue #753 scope: "detect/report drift between a
 * projection and its source"). Computes a FRESH, full (unbounded) control
 * total straight from each `rebuildSource` stream's authoritative table —
 * deliberately the SAME source contract a rebuild would re-derive from,
 * so "reconcile" and "rebuild" always agree about what the correct value
 * IS, even though reconciliation itself never mutates anything (a plain
 * `COUNT(*)`/`COUNT(*) FILTER (...)` read, same "zero mutation, safe to
 * retry, no Idempotency-Key needed" posture `data_lifecycle`'s dry-run
 * endpoint already established).
 *
 * A mismatch is NOT necessarily a bug — a projection that is merely
 * `"delayed"` (has not yet caught up to the latest source rows) will
 * legitimately reconcile with a mismatch until its next successful
 * incremental pass. That is reconciliation doing its job (surfacing
 * drift), not a false positive; callers should read the freshness status
 * alongside a reconciliation result, not instead of it.
 *
 * Takes the CALLER's own already-open transaction (`tx`) — same
 * "route-invoked mutations run inside the route's own `withTenant`
 * transaction, never a nested one" convention every other application
 * function invoked from an API route in this repo follows.
