/**
 * The one outbound HTTP seam for push adapters (Issue #466).
 *
 * Every network call this module makes goes through `ssrfSafeFetch`
 * (`src/lib/auth/ssrf-guard.ts`) rather than bare `fetch`. That is not
 * ceremony: the destinations here are resolved from a service-account
 * credential (`token_uri`) and from a subscription row (a Web Push endpoint
 * URL), and both are values that arrive from outside this code. A hostile or
 * merely wrong one pointing at `169.254.169.254` or at a loopback admin port
 * would otherwise be fetched by the worker with whatever network position it
 * holds — and the worker holds a database connection.
 *
 * The seam is a TYPE, not a wrapper around `fetch`, so tests can drive an
 * adapter without network access and without having to defeat the guard. A
 * test that had to disable the guard to run would be testing a different code
 * path than production runs.
