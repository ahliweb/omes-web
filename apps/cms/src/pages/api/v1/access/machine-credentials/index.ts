/**
 * `POST /api/v1/access/machine-credentials` (ADR-0049) — issues a credential
 * bound to a service account, returning the plaintext token exactly once.
 *
 * ## Two classes, and a DIFFERENT permission for the second (ADR-0092)
 *
 * A request that names no `allowedWriteActions` is the read-only credential
 * ADR-0049 shipped, gated on `machine_credentials.create` exactly as before. A
 * request that names some is the write class, and it is gated on
 * `machine_credentials_write.create` instead.
 *
 * Reusing one permission for both was the obvious shape and the wrong one: it
 * would hand write-minting authority, on merge day, to everybody who already
 * holds `create` — a grant widening itself with no grant being edited. The
 * program this endpoint belongs to (#423) is built on the rule that no change
 * may leave the tree with authorization looser than it found it, and this is
 * the cheapest place that rule could have been broken.
 *
 * The split is resolved from the parsed body via `defineTenantRoute`'s callback
 * form of `authorize`, so the guard is decided BEFORE the transaction opens and
 * the body cannot pick a weaker check than the thing it asks for.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT idempotency-keyed
 *
 * Every other high-risk mutation here takes an `Idempotency-Key` and replays
 * the stored response. Replaying THIS one would mean persisting the plaintext
 * token in `awcms_idempotency_keys` so it could be handed out again — a secret
 * stored in a table designed for request bookkeeping, readable by anything that
 * can read that table, for the sake of a retry. A duplicate submit instead
 * mints a second credential, which is visible in the list above and revocable
 * in one call. That is the cheaper failure.
