/**
 * `GET /api/v1/auth/sessions` — where am I signed in? (Gelombang 2 of #423.)
 *
 * ## No permission, deliberately
 *
 * Self-service, exactly like `GET /api/v1/auth/session` and the push-device
 * endpoints: the subject is the caller, and the route never accepts a
 * `tenantUserId` to act on. Inventing a permission for "see your own sessions"
 * would put a wall in front of the feature and, worse, install the latent-authz
 * trap ADR-0058 §E describes — an action nothing seeds denies everyone,
 * including the tenant owner, while the calling code reads as correctly
 * guarded.
 *
 * Listing OTHER people's sessions is a different endpoint and does need a
 * permission. It is not this one.
 *
 * ## What it does not return
 *
 * No token, no token hash, no raw IP, no raw `User-Agent`. `clientIpHash` is a
 * keyed pseudonym and is `null` on a deployment without `AUTH_IP_HASH_SECRET`
 * — the fallback key is per-process, so a stored hash would stop being
 * comparable after a restart and the list would show one device as several.
 * Saying `null` is the honest answer; a wrong grouping is the one that produces
 * a wrong revocation.
 *
 * `current` marks the session making the request, so a person can tell which
 * row is the browser they are looking at.
