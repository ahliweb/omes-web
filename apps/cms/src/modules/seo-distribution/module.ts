/**
 * `seo_distribution` — admitted by ADR-0038 (adapting awcms-micro ADR-0028), ported
 * additively net-new under the absorb-awcms-micro program (ADR-0035,
 * `docs/awcms/absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md` Wave 1). **This is the DISCOVERY
 * scope of that module** — see "Deliberately deferred" below.
 *
 * ## What this module OWNS (discovery scope)
 *
 * The central, tenant/domain/locale-aware SEO metadata renderer for public pages
 * plus the public discovery/syndication surfaces:
 *
 * - The central document builder/renderer (`domain/seo-document.ts` +
 *   `domain/seo-head-rendering.ts`) that turns one resource's `SeoResourceFacts`
 *   (the frozen `_shared/ports/seo-facts-port.ts` contribution contract) plus this
 *   module's per-tenant SEO defaults (`awcms_seo_tenant_settings`, sql/057 + sql/059)
 *   plus the tenant's server-derived primary host (`tenant_domain`, migration 046)
 *   into a single deterministic `<head>`: canonical URL, reciprocal `hreflang`
 *   alternates + `x-default`, title/description/robots meta, Open Graph + Twitter
 *   card, and controlled schema.org JSON-LD.
 * - The public XML/text discovery routes at the host root — `/robots.txt`, the
 *   sitemap index + bounded child sitemaps (`/sitemap.xml`, `/sitemap-{n}.xml`), and
 *   RSS/Atom/JSON feeds (`/feed.xml`, `/atom.xml`, `/feed.json`) — served as public
 *   Astro routes (NOT OpenAPI), aggregating the SAME frozen `seo_facts` contract,
 *   host server-derived from `tenant_domain`, with HTTP cache validators
 *   (ETag/Last-Modified/304) and per-tenant feed config (sql/059).
 * - The tenant SEO config admin surface: `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/seo/config`
 *   (`src/pages/api/v1/seo/config.ts`), ABAC-gated by `config.read`/`config.update`
 *   (sql/058), tenant-scoped (`withTenant` + RLS FORCE), the `PUT` audited.
 *
 * ## Direction of the arrow (ADR-0038 §2) — this module DEPENDS on nothing but Core
 *
 * `seo_distribution` is the CONSUMER/aggregator: content modules PROVIDE
 * `seo_facts`; this module discovers their adapters at the route composition root
 * and injects them. So `consumes` names `seo_facts` (from `blog_content`, the module
 * that owns the public content resources SEO renders) and `media_library`
 * (OG/Twitter/Organization image resolution) — both `optional: true`, degrading
 * safely when a tenant hasn't enabled them. NO existing module is made to depend on
 * `seo_distribution`, and its lifecycle `dependencies` are ONLY the two Core modules
 * (`capabilities.consumes` is not a lifecycle edge — `module-contract.ts`), keeping
 * the DAG acyclic.
 *
 * ## Landed in ADR-0039 (redirect-governance scope — companion to ADR-0038)
 *
 * Controlled, tenant-contained redirect governance + broken-link telemetry:
 * exact-path redirect rules (`awcms_seo_redirects`, sql/060, RLS FORCE'd) resolved in
 * `src/middleware.ts` on the non-`/admin` branch BEFORE public content routing and
 * EXCLUDING admin/API/auth/static/system/discovery paths
 * (`domain/redirect-eligibility.ts`, enforced at BOTH resolve and write time); the
 * retirement 301 for the removed `/news/**` family → `/blog/{tenantCode}/**`
 * (ADR-0071 §4, NOT policy-gated — the inverse of the ADR-0039 rewrite it
 * replaces); audited URL-change capture; bounded non-recursive
 * chain/loop prevention (`domain/redirect-chain.ts`, every `verified_external` target
 * on the tenant's own hosts folded back into loop detection); privacy-minimized 404
 * governance (`awcms_seo_not_found_observations`, sql/060, aggregate + retention-bound
 * via the `dataLifecycle` descriptor below); and the admin API under
 * `/api/v1/seo/redirects/*` + `/api/v1/seo/not-found/*`. EVERY redirect target — on
 * write AND on every resolve — flows through the frozen `assertSafeRedirectTarget`
 * open-redirect guard (`domain/redirect-target-classification.ts`); normalization
 * (`domain/redirect-path.ts`) rejects CRLF/traversal/Unicode-confusion/protocol-
 * relative; there is no pattern engine → no ReDoS. Tenant resolution is
 * host-based-only first cut (ADR-0039); a path-tenant strategy is a documented
 * deferred follow-up. awcms has NO i18n/locale seam, so `locale` is always `null`.
 *
 * ## Admin screen (`navigation`)
 *
 * `navigation` used to be undeclared here, on the grounds that the redirect/404
 * surface was "an API, not an admin screen". That left the module INVISIBLE in the
 * sidebar even though every one of its eight permissions was routed — an operator
 * holding them had no way to reach any of it. `/admin/seo`
 * (`src/pages/admin/seo.astro`) closes that: ONE screen with four panels (SEO
 * defaults, redirect policy, redirect rules + recovery, 404 governance), so the loop
 * an operator actually runs — see a 404, create the rule that fixes it, resolve the
 * observation — stays on one page. The entry's `requiredPermission` is
 * `config.read`, the gate on the screen's leading panel; a viewer holding only
 * `redirect.read`/`not_found.read` therefore does not see the link, which is the
 * accepted cost of a single entry (the alternative, splitting the screen, doubles
 * the nav entries and the labelKeys for one operator task). `group` is deliberately
 * NOT set — `DEFAULT_MODULE_TYPE` places this module under `system` and wins over it.
 *
 * `events` and `jobs` stay undeclared: resolution is live per request (bounded);
 * URL-change capture is an audited synchronous hook, not yet a published domain
 * event; and 404 retention rides the generic data_lifecycle purge engine (declared
 * below), not a module-owned job.

Owns `awcms_seo_tenant_settings` (sql/057 + sql/059 — per-tenant SEO defaults: site identity, default social image, Twitter handle, Organization identity, a tenant-wide noindex switch, and feed/sitemap discovery config, RLS FORCE'd) and the central document builder/renderer (`domain/seo-document.ts` + `domain/seo-head-rendering.ts`) that emits canonical URL, reciprocal hreflang alternates + x-default, title/description/robots meta, Open Graph + Twitter card, and controlled schema.org JSON-LD. It is the CONSUMER/aggregator of the frozen `seo_facts` contribution contract (`_shared/ports/seo-facts-port.ts`): content modules (`blog_content`, and any future content type) PROVIDE `SeoResourceFacts`; this module discovers their adapters at the route composition root and never imports a content module's internals. The canonical host is server-derived from the tenant's verified primary domain (`tenant_domain`), NEVER a request header (host-header-poisoning defense); OG/Organization images resolve through `media_library` (same-tenant, verified); JSON-LD is emitted only through the port's `renderControlledJsonLd` guard (injection blocked by a controlled `@type`/key schema, not ad-hoc sanitization); publication state is honored via the port's `isPubliclyResolvable`/`isPubliclyIndexable` (draft/scheduled/archived/deleted/private/unpublished/noindex never reach public output); and the render/discovery cache keys are tenant-first (`buildSeoCacheKey`/`buildDiscoverySignature`). The public discovery surfaces — robots.txt, the sitemap index + bounded child sitemaps, and RSS/Atom/JSON feeds — are public Astro XML/text routes aggregating the same `seo_facts` contract, with tenant/domain/locale-specific ETag/Last-Modified caching and per-tenant feed config (sql/059). ADR-0039 adds the redirect-governance scope: controlled tenant-contained exact-path redirect rules (`awcms_seo_redirects`, sql/060, RLS FORCE'd) resolved in `src/middleware.ts` before public content routing and EXCLUDING admin/API/auth/static/system/discovery paths (`domain/redirect-eligibility.ts`, enforced at BOTH resolve and write time), the retirement 301 for the removed `/news/**` family (ADR-0039 shipped the rewrite the OTHER way and INERT because no `/news` family existed; ADR-0059 gave it a destination; ADR-0071 §4 removed that destination again and inverted the mapping, so `/news/**` now 301s to `/blog/{tenantCode}/**` — NOT policy-gated, because the routes are gone for everyone, and skipped only for a tenant whose `legacyTenantRouteEnabled` is false since it would be a 301 to a certain 404), audited URL-change capture, bounded non-recursive chain/loop prevention, privacy-minimized 404 telemetry (`awcms_seo_not_found_observations`, sql/060, with a `dataLifecycle` analytics_telemetry descriptor + `awcms_worker` purge grant), and the admin API under `/api/v1/seo/redirects/*` + `/api/v1/seo/not-found/*` — every redirect target routed through the frozen `assertSafeRedirectTarget` open-redirect guard on write AND resolve.

Still not partitioned, but on the honest reason: a per-IP rate limit now fronts every write (`presentation/redirect-middleware.ts`) and the 30d default retention window plus the tenant+last_seen_at index keeps the age-based purge cheap, so the steady-state volume stays far below what range-partitioning is for.
