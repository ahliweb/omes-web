/**
 * The ONLY file that reads or writes `awcms_principals` — ADR-0085, Gelombang 7
 * PR 7.1 of Issue #423.
 *
 * That exclusivity is not a convention. `bun run identity:principal-access:check`
 * enforces it, and it is control 2 of the four that stand in for RLS on this
 * table: **RLS bounds which ROWS a query may see; that gate bounds which CALL
 * SITES may issue one at all.**
 *
 * ## Two shapes, and the reason for the split
 *
 * `password_hash` is returned by exactly one function — `loadPrincipalSecret` —
 * and that function's result must never be spread into a response, an event, a
 * log line, or another module's type. Every other reader gets
 * `PrincipalIdentity`, which does not carry the field at all, so the ordinary
 * way to use this module is also the safe one. That is control 3: the projection
 * invariant is a TYPE, not a review habit.
 *
 * ## Every query is keyed, and unbounded reads are impossible by construction
 *
 * There is no `listPrincipals`, no search, no pagination, and no `LIKE`. A
 * credential table with a scan is a credential table with an enumeration
 * endpoint one refactor away. The gate rejects any query here that is not keyed
 * on `id =` or `email_normalized =`, so adding one is a red build rather than a
 * review comment.
 *
 * ## Holding a principal grants NOTHING
 *
 * A principal is an AUTHENTICATION fact, never an AUTHORIZATION fact. Nothing in
 * this file resolves a permission, a role, or a tenant membership, and nothing
 * ever should: authorization stays on `awcms_tenant_users` under FORCE RLS,
 * reached through the chokepoint. If a future reader wants "what may this
 * principal do", the answer is that the question is malformed — a principal does
 * not act; a tenant user does.

 * new mistake: under READ COMMITTED — what `sql.begin` gives — two concurrent
 * failures that both SELECT N and both write N+1 cost ONE increment, so K
 * parallel attempts cost one. The increment and the conditional lock are both
 * expressions evaluated by PostgreSQL against the current row.
 *
 * The counter is NOT reset when the lock fires: a successful login is what
 * clears it (`clearPrincipalLockout`). That is the identity counter's behaviour
 * preserved exactly, and it differs from `mfa.ts` on purpose — the same
