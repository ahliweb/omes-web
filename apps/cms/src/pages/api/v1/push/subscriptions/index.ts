/**
 * `GET|POST /api/v1/push/subscriptions` (Issue #466) — a person's OWN devices.
 *
 * ## Why self-service and not a permission
 *
 * `defineSelfServiceTenantRoute` exists for endpoints whose subject is the
 * caller (ADR-0049 §7). Registering the browser you are sitting in front of is
 * the clearest case there is: the answer to "may I subscribe this device?" is
 * "you are holding its session", and there is no id to compare against anything
 * because the route never accepts one — `tenantUserId` comes from the resolved
 * session and from nowhere else.
 *
 * Inventing a `push_delivery.subscriptions.create` permission instead would be
 * the latent-authz trap this repo has hit before: an action no role seeds, so
 * enabling notifications silently 403s for every user including the owner,
 * while the calling code reads as though it were correctly guarded. Push
 * notifications are for ordinary users, and a permission wall in front of them
 * is a wall in front of the feature.
 *
 * What DOES belong to a permission — seeing everybody's devices, cancelling
 * queued messages, sending a test — lives at `/api/v1/push/diagnostics` and its
 * siblings, behind the chokepoint.
 *
 * ## A suspended tenant may not register
 *
 * ADR-0073 made suspension a SERVICE status rather than a login status, and the
 * chokepoint enforces it for every guarded route. A self-service route has no
 * chokepoint — so `defineSelfServiceTenantRoute` now carries the refusal for
 * the whole class, and neither verb here opts out.
 *
 * This file used to do it by hand, on `POST` only. The `DELETE` sibling never
 * had it, and that asymmetry is what showed the omission was accidental: a
 * per-route copy is enforced by whoever remembers, and eleven other routes in
 * this class did not. Unregistering a device DOES stay reachable, because it
 * removes a delivery target and grants nothing.
