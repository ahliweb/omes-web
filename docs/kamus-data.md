# Data dictionary

Every column across the thirty-eight `awcms_commerce_*` tables, its meaning, its unit/enum domain, and — where one exists — its source column in the legacy `commerce_bj_mart` MySQL schema.

## Provenance, stated once so every row below does not have to repeat it

The legacy column list was **recorded from the live `commerce_bj_mart` database on 2026-09-14**, during the work that produced issue #4's source-schema section and `apps/cms/sql/901_awcms_commerce_schema.sql`. **`commerce_bj_mart` is not reachable from the machine any of this documentation was written on** — every "source column" cell is stated **as recorded on 2026-09-14**, not independently re-checked since. The catalog-core and BjekMart-parity columns (this document's first two tables) were ported from the legacy schema's own column names, unchanged — `sql/901`'s and `sql/904`'s own headers, and `commerce/module.ts`'s docblock, all describe this as a direct port; corroborated by the deferred-column list still matching legacy `commerce_bj_mart.products` column names verbatim. The marketing and orders tables (issues #26/#29) are this platform's **own new design**, not a column-for-column port — mart.borneojek.com has settings and order records with a similar shape, but no legacy column list for them was captured during this repository's development, so no "source column" is claimed for that section; each column's meaning is stated on its own terms instead.

## `awcms_commerce_categories` ← `commerce_bj_mart.categories`

| `price_level_2`/`_3`/`_4` | `price_level_2`/`_3`/`_4` | Tiered pricing by customer level | `numeric(14,2)`, nullable |

| `stock` | `stock` | Units on hand | Non-negative integer |
| `status` | `status` | Lifecycle state | `draft`, `active`, `inactive`, `archived` — see [`docs/cms.md`](cms.md) |

| `promo_banner_show`/`_title`/`_subtitle`/`_badge`/`_icon`/`_color` | same names | An optional promotional banner rendered on the product detail page | Boolean / free text ×5 |
| `size_chart_type` | `size_chart_type` | How a size chart is presented, if at all | `none`, `image`, `table` |
| `size_chart_media_id` | `size_chart_media_id` | The size-chart image, when `type = "image"` | `uuid`, FK `awcms_news_media_objects` (the media registry), UUID-shaped validation only |
| `size_chart_details` | `size_chart_details` | The size-chart rows, when `type = "table"` | `jsonb`, nullable |
| `service_form` | `service_form` | A service product's intake-form field definitions | `jsonb`, nullable |

| `created_at`/`updated_at`/`deleted_at`/`restored_at` | *(timestamps / new)* | Row lifecycle | `timestamptz` |

**Not ported from `commerce_bj_mart.products`:** every legacy `affiliate_*` column, and the legacy `product_affiliate_links` table. The affiliate program was rebuilt fresh instead, per [ADR-0016](adr/0016-customer-accounts-are-otp-verified-commerce-accounts-with-bearer-sessions.md)'s D5 decision and [issue #92](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-one/issues/92): `awcms_commerce_affiliates` (one row per enrolled customer — `code` an 8-char unambiguous alphabet, unique per tenant; `commission_rate` a `numeric(5,2)` snapshot copied from `awcms_commerce_store_settings.affiliate_commission_rate` at enrolment time; `status` `active`/`suspended`) and `awcms_commerce_affiliate_commissions` (one row per order that ever earned a commission — `order_id` unique per tenant, forever; `base_amount`/`rate`/`amount` snapshots; `status` `pending → approved/void → paid`). No legacy column or table survives — this is a fresh design, not a port. See [`docs/skema-basis-data.md`](skema-basis-data.md) for the exact columns.

## `awcms_commerce_product_images` / `awcms_commerce_product_variants` ← `commerce_bj_mart.product_images` / `.product_variants`

Both are new AWCMS tables carrying the legacy tables' own concepts forward: an image is `{product, media reference, sort order, alt text}`; a variant is `{product, an attribute name/value pair such as "Warna"/"Merah", its own price/price-tier/stock/weight overrides, an optional image}`. See [`docs/skema-basis-data.md`](skema-basis-data.md) for the exact columns — this dictionary does not repeat them field-for-field a second time, since neither table's column meaning differs from its schema-doc description.

## The increment-2 migration constraint (unchanged from increment 1)

**The data migration must carry every legacy product slug verbatim, including its 4-character Laravel-generated uniqueness suffix** (for example `beras-5-kg-dbfc`, `jasa-jemput-kbj1`) — the CMS must never regenerate a slug from a product's name. [ADR-0005](adr/0005-product-urls-match-the-live-sites-shape.md) commits this platform's product URLs to the live site's own shape, `/product/{slug}`, specifically so every indexed link, bookmark, and shared URL keeps resolving at cutover.

## Marketing tables: this platform's own design, not a legacy port

`awcms_commerce_flash_sales`/`_flash_sale_products`, `_vouchers`, `_sliders`, `_testimonials`, `_popups`, `_store_settings` (issue #26) were designed against mart.borneojek.com's *observed behaviour* (a flash-sale strip with a countdown, a voucher code field at checkout, a home-page slider, a testimonials section, a promo popup, and store-wide settings including bank/QRIS details) rather than against a captured legacy column list — see "Provenance" above. Column meanings are documented in full in [`docs/skema-basis-data.md`](skema-basis-data.md); this dictionary does not duplicate them, since there is no legacy-mapping column to add beside each one.

## Order tables: this platform's own design, addressed by guest identity

`awcms_commerce_customers`/`_customer_addresses`/`_orders`/`_order_items`/`_order_events`/`_payment_confirmations`/`_reviews`/`_wishlists` (issue #29) are likewise this platform's own schema, shaped by [ADR-0009](adr/0009-guest-checkout-by-order-code-and-phone.md) (a customer is identified by phone, not an account) and [ADR-0010](adr/0010-manual-payment-and-alternative-courier-first-gateways-via-outbox.md) (manual payment and a flat alternative-courier cost, not a live gateway/carrier integration). See [`docs/skema-basis-data.md`](skema-basis-data.md) for every column.

## seputarborneo.com → `blog_content` / `seo_distribution` (issue #58)

Column mapping for `tools/import-seputarborneo.ts` (`bun run import:seputarborneo`), which reads seputarborneo's legacy MariaDB archive and EXPORTS it to `apps/cms`'s own operator pipeline (`bun run blog:legacy:import`, Issue #599/ADR-0114 in upstream awcms) — see `docs/deployment.md`'s "Importing seputarborneo" for the full runbook. Never a legacy column list ported verbatim into a new table: `blog_content`'s schema (Portable Text body, term/institution classification) already exists and predates this exporter.

### `berita_red` → `tools/out/seputarborneo/posts.ndjson`, one `LegacyImportRecord` per line

| Legacy column | NDJSON field (`legacy-import-record.ts`'s shape) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id_ber` | `legacyId` | `blog:legacy:import` writes this into `awcms_blog_posts.legacy_source_id` (`sql/138`) — a real, queryable provenance column, unlike this issue's first pass which had no way to write it |
| `judul` | `title`, and the slug source | `slug = sbSlug(judul)`, de-duplicated with `-{id_ber}` on collision — written into the NDJSON `slug` field VERBATIM, and inserted verbatim by `importLegacyBlogPost` (checked directly) |
| `sub_judul` | `excerpt` | |
| `isi_berita` | `bodyHtml` | The RAW legacy HTML, untouched — `blog:legacy:import` itself runs `convertLegacyHtmlToPortableText` (`<script>`/`<iframe>`/`<embed>`/`<object>` refused, an `<img>` needs `--media-map` or the whole row is refused) |
| `jenis_rubrik` + `kategori` | `categories: [name]` | Normalized identically to `migrations/2026-09-02-normalize-legacy-taxonomy.sql`, then reduced to ONE flat legacy category name (`kategori` alone already disambiguates every non-plain-rubrik case) — resolved to a term via `--term-map`, built from this exporter's own `term-map-hints.json` |
| `tgl` + `jam` | `publishedAt`, `status` | Asia/Jakarta (UTC+7, no DST) wall-clock → UTC instant, written straight into the NDJSON as an ISO string — `blog:legacy:import` backdates `published_at` for real, unlike the public API |
| `user` | *(dropped)* | `legacy-import-record.ts` has no per-row author/sidecar field, and `--author=<uuid>` is one value for the whole run — a real, unavoidable gap, see `docs/deployment.md` |
| `id_logo` | *(not in this NDJSON)* | Matched against `logo` separately, for issue #59 — see below |
| `foto_berita` | `featuredImageSrc` | `blog:legacy:import` REFUSES the whole row if this is set and `--media-map` does not resolve it — every one of the ~25,489 rows carries one, so a media upload pass is a hard precondition of any commit, not an optional nicety |
| `status` (the legacy column) | *(never read)* | The legacy site itself never read it (`include/rubrik.php` uses the `berita_red_tayang` VIEW's own `tgl`+`jam` <= now filter instead) — not to be confused with the NDJSON's OWN `status` field above, which this exporter computes from `tgl`/`jam` |
| `sub_up`, `text_foto`, `uk`, `tp`, `rate_view`, `like_view`, `unlike_viuew`, `hari`, `bln` | *(not imported)* | No corresponding concept on `blog_content` |

**Institutions, separately.** `blog:legacy:import` calls `syncPostTermAssignments` but never `syncPostInstitutionAssignments` (checked directly) — a `DAERAH`/`MITRA BORNEO` article imports with no institution at all. `bun run import:seputarborneo -- --assign-institutions` closes this over the public API AFTER `blog:legacy:import --commit`, `PATCH`ing `institutionIds` by looking the post up by its own exported `slug`.

### `awcms_seo_redirects` — `tools/out/seputarborneo/redirects.json` (origin `legacy_blog`)

Built directly by this exporter, not derived through `blog:legacy:redirects:import` — see `docs/deployment.md` for why that sibling script's own `{legacyId}`/`{slug}` templating is wrong for the ~171 rows with a collision-suffixed stored slug. One entry per legacy URL form, targeting `/blog/{tenantCode}/{slug}` (the SAME slug `blog:legacy:import` stores), with `origin: "legacy_blog"` — the ONLY origin `apps/storefront`'s `getLegacyRedirectRows()` serves (an `import`-origin row is ignored by the storefront's build):

| Source path | Built from |
| --- | --- |
| `/news/{id_ber}-{sbSlug(judul)}.html` | Today's (post-issue-#6) URL shape |
| `/news/{id_ber}_{judul with spaces→underscores, rawurlencode'd}.html` | The pre-2.0 shape a search engine may still have indexed — built from the RAW title, never the stored slug |
| `/video/{id_vid}-{sbSlug(judul_vid)}.html` | A SYNTHETIC, query-free key — never a public URL. `berita_vid`'s real URL was `/video/?video={id_vid}-{slug}.html`, but the CMS strips a redirect source's query string at write time, so that form would collapse every video row onto the bare `/video`. The storefront answers the real `?video={id}` URL by id from this key (`docs/routing.md`, "Legacy redirects"). One key per video: the request-time rule matches by id only |

Posted via `POST /api/v1/seo/redirects/import` by `bun run import:seputarborneo -- --push-redirects [--commit]`, chunked to `MAX_REDIRECT_IMPORT_ITEMS` (200), each chunk under an `Idempotency-Key` derived from its content (`tools/lib/redirect-push.ts`).

### `berita_vid` → `tools/out/seputarborneo/videos.ndjson`

| Legacy column | NDJSON field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `judul_vid` | `title`, slug source | Same `sbSlug`/collision rule as `berita_red` |
| `link` | a plain link inside `bodyHtml` | `legacy-import-record.ts` has NO content-block field — only `bodyHtml` — so there is nowhere to put an embedded `videoNews` block through this pipeline. Normalized via a YouTube-id/URL parser kept in exact step with `apps/cms`'s own `normalizeYouTubeVideoId`, then appended as `<a href="https://youtu.be/{id}">` — a real, documented degradation (link, not embed) |
| `text_vid` | `bodyHtml` (prefix, before the link) | Raw HTML, untouched, same as `isi_berita` |
| `tgl` + `jam` | `publishedAt`, `status` | Legacy-formatted (`YYMMDD`/`HHMMSS`, per seputarborneo's own video-time-normalization migrations), reformatted before the same date logic `berita_red` uses |
| `admin` | *(dropped)* | Same caveat as `berita_red`'s `user` |
| `kategori`, `status` (legacy column) | *(not imported)* | No per-video taxonomy or status concept carried over by this exporter |

### `ikl_online` → an ad placement (`POST /api/v1/news-portal/ad-placements`)

Row count read for the export summary only — this exporter writes no file for it. Creation requires a verified `mediaObjectId`, and `img_ikl` (the creative filename) is not fetched or uploaded here (see `docs/deployment.md`).

### `logo` → institution logos (for issue #59)

Row count read for the export summary only. `awcms_blog_institutions` carries no `logo_media_id` column in this repository's `apps/cms` yet (that lands via [issue #59](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-one/issues/59)'s upstream subtree pull); matching `nama` against [issue #57](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-one/issues/57)'s 24 seeded institutions is that issue's to do once the column exists.

### `config` → `tools/out/seputarborneo/site-profile.json`, merged into `PUT /api/v1/site-profile`

| Legacy column | AWCMS field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `motho` | `tagline` | |
| `coppyright` | `copyrightNotice` | |
| `alamat` | `editorialAddress` | |
| `email` | `contactEmail` | |
| `wasupport` | `whatsappNumber` | |
| `fb`/`tw`/`ig`/`yt`/`tt`/`th` | `socialLinks[]` | Platform labels `facebook`/`x`/`instagram`/`youtube`/`tiktok`/`threads`; only `http(s)` values pass `/api/v1/site-profile`'s own absolute-URL validator (any other value is silently omitted from this exporter's own output) |
| `title`, `redaksi`, `link_coppy`, `ico`, `logo` | *(not applied)* | No field on `/api/v1/site-profile` today (checked directly against `site-profile-validation.ts`) |

`PUT /api/v1/site-profile` is a full replace, so applying `site-profile.json` means `GET`ting the current profile first and merging (`bun run db:seed:cms`'s own fields like `logoMediaId` survive; the fields above overwrite).

### Not imported at all, and why

- **`users`** — identities are not migrated (PII); the seputarborneo admin accounts have no equivalent AWCMS user, and the article's `user`/`admin` column is dropped entirely (above), never a login.
- **`counter`** — visitor IP addresses; no consent record, no purpose once BjekMart/seputarborneo runs on `visitor-analytics` (issue #56/A10) instead.
- **`newsletter_subscribers`** — counted and reported, never imported: no consent record survives from the legacy signup form, and `apps/cms`'s own newsletter is double opt-in (epic #46's own Decision 2). A later `--with-subscribers` flag may add them as `pending` after a legal decision, per issue #58's own Scope.
- **`renungan_rmd`, `tanya_jawab`** — dead tables on the live site (nothing links to them).
- **`foto_berita`** (the gallery table, distinct from `berita_red.foto_berita` the COLUMN) — an unused gallery feature the public site never rendered.

## Point-of-sale vocabulary on `awcms_commerce_orders` (issue #116, contract #106 D6)

BjekMart's kasir (`commerce_bj_mart`'s counter sales, recorded in the legacy `orders`/`transactions` tables by payment method alone — the legacy schema had no separate channel column, so a cash sale was recognisable only by its payment type) is re-expressed here as three additive facts on the SAME orders table, not a second ledger:

| Term | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel` | `awcms_commerce_orders.channel` — `text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'storefront'`, `CHECK IN ('storefront','pos')` (`sql/931`); `PublicOrderRecord.channel`/`OrderDetail.channel` on the wire | WHERE the order was placed. `storefront` = every anonymous/bearer checkout through `/api/v1/commerce/storefront/*`, and every order created before issue #116 (the column default); `pos` = a counter sale created by staff through `POST /api/v1/commerce/pos/orders`. Independent of `payment_method` (HOW it was paid) — a channel is never inferred from a payment method. The storefront read paths serve `channel = 'storefront'` only; POS history serves `channel = 'pos'` only; the admin order list serves both |
| `cash` | one more `payment_method` value (`CHECK IN ('manual_bank','manual_qris','dp','gateway','cash')`, `sql/931`); `PaymentMethod` in `domain/commerce-order-types.ts`, re-exported by `packages/kontrak` | Physical cash handed over at the counter. POS-only: `domain/pos-order-validation.ts` accepts `cash` and `manual_qris`; the storefront checkout's `domain/order-request-validation.ts` refuses `cash` (`400 VALIDATION_ERROR`) because a shopper online never hands cash to this platform. A `cash` order is `paid` from the moment it exists |
| `amountTendered` / `change` | `POST /api/v1/commerce/pos/orders` request/response (not stored as columns — the receipt's own arithmetic; the audit event `commerce.pos.sale` records both) | The cash the customer handed over and `amountTendered − total`, both `numeric(14,2)` **strings** ([ADR-0003](adr/0003-money-is-numeric-14-2-and-crosses-the-wire-as-a-string.md)), computed in `bigint` cents by `computeChange`. Required for `cash`, `null` for `manual_qris`. A tender below the total is refused (`409 INSUFFICIENT_TENDER`), never a negative change |
| `pos_cashier_tenant_user_id` | `awcms_commerce_orders.pos_cashier_tenant_user_id uuid` (`sql/931`); `cashierTenantUserId` on the wire | The `awcms_tenant_users.id` of the staff member who rang the sale up. A plain stamp, not a foreign key (a fiscal record outlives a staff account). `NULL` on every `storefront` order. The POS history's `?cashier=` filter axis |
| walk-in sentinel phone | `POS_WALK_IN_CUSTOMER_SENTINEL_PHONE` = **`+620000000000`** (`domain/phone-normalisation.ts`, the single source of truth for the literal); the row's name is `POS_WALK_IN_CUSTOMER_NAME` = `Pelanggan Walk-in` | The one `awcms_commerce_customers` row per tenant that every no-phone counter sale is attached to (`customers.phone` is `NOT NULL` and unique per tenant, so the sentinel is what makes the row unique). Already E.164-normalised (`+62` + ten zeros — no Indonesian subscriber number has a national part starting `0`), so it round-trips through `normalizePhoneNumber` unchanged and is never confused with a real customer. Refused as a customer identity on the storefront checkout, and never served by the storefront tracking lookup — a documented value must not become a credential for reading walk-in receipts |
| `commerce.pos.create` | `awcms_permissions` (`sql/932`); `COMMERCE_POS_PERMISSIONS.create` | The ONE permission-gated order-creation path in the module. POS history reuses `commerce.orders.read` |
| `commerce.pos.sale` | `awcms_audit_events.action` | The audit event every counter sale writes (order code, total, method, tendered, change, walk-in flag, line count — never the customer's name or phone) |

## Deferred columns and tables — not ported

- **A live RajaOngkir courier-RATE table is done** (issue #107, `sql/924` — `awcms_commerce_courier_destinations`/`_shipping_rates`, a cached rate the order path validates against, never a synchronous provider call). What is still deferred: live courier TRACKING (a shipped parcel's own status) — `shipping_method`/`shipping_service_name` on an order remain merchant-defined labels for the `alternative`/`self_pickup` methods; a `courier` shipment's rate is now live, its post-dispatch tracking is not (named as a follow-up in [ADR-0017](adr/0017-external-providers-are-commerce-owned-ports-with-env-credentials-and-token-addressed-webhooks.md)).
- **A payment-gateway transaction record is done** — `awcms_commerce_payment_gateway_sessions`/`_payment_events` (`sql/926`, issues #110/#113), built through the outbox per [ADR-0010](adr/0010-manual-payment-and-alternative-courier-first-gateways-via-outbox.md)/[ADR-0017](adr/0017-external-providers-are-commerce-owned-ports-with-env-credentials-and-token-addressed-webhooks.md). Deferred: a Xendit adapter behind the same `PaymentGatewayProvider` port (`midtrans`/`log` only today).
- **A real media upload for product images, slider media, payment-confirmation proof images, and ad-placement creatives** — resolved through `media_library`'s existing reference/URL mechanism, but this increment's seed uses placeholder SVGs/PNGs and the anonymous proof-upload endpoint is a stub (`503 MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`); ad placements need a REAL R2-verified media object (`mediaObjectId` is required, not optional), so issue #57's seed step creates none of the 12 locally — see [`docs/cms.md`](cms.md) and [`docs/deployment.md`](deployment.md).
