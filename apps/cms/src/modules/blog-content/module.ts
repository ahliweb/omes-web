    "Tenant-scoped blog/content management, ported from awcms-mini (epic #536, issues #537-#543 plus the later #636-#649/#681 hardening lineage — see README.md for the full port-adaptation notes). Admin CRUD + lifecycle for posts/pages (draft -> review -> scheduled/published -> archived, soft delete/restore/purge), hierarchical categories/tags with post-term relations, PostgreSQL full-text search, append-only revision history (restore never overwrites, it appends a new revision), presentation/monetization extensions (templates, hierarchical menus, position-based widgets, advertisements with placement targeting/scheduling, a per-tenant theme override falling back to `awcms_tenants.default_theme`), an optional `translation_group_id` linking locale-variants of one post, a whitelisted `gallery`/`video_news` content_json block type (no raw HTML, no new media table), per-tenant blog settings (title/description/RSS/sitemap flags), and automatic internal tag linking (a pure render-time transform, `domain/internal-tag-linking.ts`, gated by a deployment-wide config plus a per-tenant policy table and a per-post opt-out column). Public (anonymous) routes under `/blog/{tenantCode}/...` per ADR-0009 (index, post detail, category/tag archive, search, RSS feed, sitemap) reuse the `resolvePublicTenantByCode` resolver theming's own public preview route already established in this base. ADR-0059 had added a SECOND, host-resolved public family `/news/**` (index, post detail, category archive, tag archive) with its own `withHostResolvedBlogTenant` gate and a `publicRouteMode` switch; ADR-0071 supersedes it and this module serves ONE public family again. `/blog/**` is this repo's permanent public vocabulary and `/news/**` belongs to `ahliweb/awcms-astro`, so the four routes, the gate, and the switch are gone — `seo_distribution` 301s the retired family to `/blog/{tenantCode}/**` for any tenant that still serves it, because those URLs were live and advertised in sitemaps and feeds this repo published. `legacyTenantRouteEnabled` survives as the single switch for the `/blog/{tenantCode}` family. The archived `publicBasePath`/`publicLabel` settings keys are NOT adopted — they change only the links a page emits and cannot repoint the file-based route that serves, which is a per-tenant generator of URLs that 404. The managed-media-reference enforcement (Issue #636/#639/#640/#649, gated by the `media_library` capability below — ADR-0036 ownership inversion; formerly `news_media`) and the publish-time social-publishing outbox trigger (Issue #643, gated by the `social_publishing` capability below) both consume a REQUIRED port parameter at their call sites. The media gate now injects `media_library`'s real adapter (`media-library/application/media-library-port-adapter.ts`) at every composition root: managed-media enforcement reports inactive (a safe no-op) for any tenant that has not enabled it, and enabling it no longer requires a news portal. `social_publishing` is still not ported to this base, so its call sites inject this module's own no-op adapter (`application/social-publishing-port-noop-adapter.ts`), which always reports `{ jobsCreated: 0 }`. Swapping in a real social-publishing adapter is a pure composition-root change (no `blog_content` file touched) once that module is ported. ADR-0044 MERGE: the `news_portal` module is retired and its two surviving features are absorbed here — the editorial homepage section composer (`GET/POST /api/v1/news-portal/homepage-sections`, `PATCH/DELETE .../{id}`, `awcms_news_portal_homepage_sections`, migration 044) and R2-only advertisement placements (`GET/POST /api/v1/news-portal/ad-placements`, `PATCH/DELETE .../{id}`, `awcms_news_portal_ad_placements`, migration 045, every row holding a real FK to a verified media object). Table names and API paths are deliberately UNCHANGED (ADR-0044 §3/§6, following ADR-0036's precedent of not renaming `awcms_news_media_objects` when its ownership moved): a rename costs every foreign key, policy, index, and consumer while buying nothing that the descriptor and inventory do not already record. The `public_content` capability this module PROVIDES was `news_portal`'s only reason to consume it, so that consumption is now an internal call; the capability itself stays declared because `seo_distribution` and future consumers still read it. Dropped in the same change, not absorbed: `awcms_news_portal_tenant_state` (migration 043) and its read helper, which had no writer in this base — the preset ACTIVATION path that would have written it was never ported, and managed-media enforcement is turned on per tenant by `media_library`'s `POST /api/v1/media/enforcement` instead (`sql/077` drops the table). The four absorbed permissions (`homepage_sections`/`ad_placements` x `read`/`configure`, seeded under `news_portal` by migrations 044/045) are repointed to this module's key by `sql/076`, which moves every existing role grant before deleting the old catalog rows so no tenant loses the capability. ADR-0044 §4 FASE 2, STEP 1 (`sql/078`): the surviving media-backed ad table gains the targeting the free-URL system had (`target_type` global/widget/post/page + `target_id`), so it can now express everything `awcms_blog_ad_placements` could — the precondition the ADR sets before `awcms_blog_ads` may be dropped. `placement_key` remains the SLOT (where on the page), `target_type`/`target_id` are the SCOPE (which pages); rendering a page returns its own targeted ads UNIONED with every global ad for that slot, which is a deliberate improvement on the retired system's exact-scope match. The pairing rule (`target_id` required for a scoped type, forbidden for `global`) is a database CHECK, not application-only as the retired table left it, and the polymorphic `target_id` is existence-checked at write time by `application/ad-placement-reference-validation.ts` since no foreign key can span three tables. Migration 078 deliberately moves NO data and drops NO table: the ingest of `awcms_blog_ads.image_url` into `media_library` (with a dry-runnable residue report) and the drop of both legacy tables are separate, later steps, in that order.",
  // `module_management` + `logging` are real value imports this module

  /**
   * `/admin/blog` is back, in the change that adds the page — which is what
   * the note that stood here promised.
   *
   * The history is worth keeping: this module declared this exact path when it
   * was ported from awcms-mini, where the page exists. It did not exist here —
   * the port brought the API and the public routes, not the authoring screens
   * — and nothing rendered descriptor navigation at the time, so the entry was
   * invisible while `descriptor-sync` published it to
   * `awcms_module_navigation` and `GET /api/v1/modules` as a valid item.
   * `tests/admin-navigation-registry.test.ts` now fails on any entry whose
   * path has no page, in both directions.
   *
   * FIVE entries for fifteen activity codes: the post lifecycle, the page
   * lifecycle, taxonomy, presentation, and settings. Homepage composition is
   * the one sibling screen still to come, and it brings its own entry when its
   * page lands — not before. `tests/admin-blog-page-contract.test.ts` pins the
   * count, so each arrival is a line someone edits deliberately.
   *
   * The pages entry is gated on `pages.read` rather than `posts.read`: they
   * are separate permissions, and an operator granted one and not the other
   * must see exactly the screen they can use.

  // `urlTemplate` carries `:tenantCode` because this base's public post route is
  // path-tenant-scoped (`/blog/{tenantCode}/{slug}`, ADR-0009) — awcms-micro's
  // descriptor used host-resolved `/news/:slug`, a route family that is NOT
  // ported here (see this module's `description`). Blog PAGES are contributed
  // too since Issue #625, and it took two changes rather than one: Issue #617
  // gave them a public route, so a hit no longer 404s, and `sql/136` gave
  // `awcms_worker` the SELECT the reconcile job needs. Registering the
  // descriptor without that grant would have passed every gate here — the
  // registry check is pure, no test touches a database — and failed at 03:00 in
  // a job nobody is watching. `site-search:sources:check` now derives that
  // requirement from the descriptors themselves, so the next contributor cannot
  // repeat it.
  //
  // This declaration adds NO dependency edge to `site_search`: the arrow points
  // inward (ADR-0040 §2) — content declares, the aggregator discovers.

   * ADR-0094 wave 2 (Issue #557).
   *
   * Published content is the TENANT's, not the author's — a post survives the
   * person who wrote it, and erasure must not empty the site. So every table
   * here answers `severed_with_subject_row`: the byline stops resolving to a
   * person when the identity is anonymised, and the article stays up.
   *
   * Only three are exportable, and the line between them is authorship. A post
   * carries a byline and the author's own words; a menu carries a `deleted_by`
   * stamp. Exporting the second kind would hand a subject the tenant's whole
   * content catalogue because they once tidied it.
   */
  /**
   * ADR-0037 (`data_lifecycle`). `blog_content` had no `dataLifecycle` array
   * until sql/131 added the institution registry: every table it owned before
   * that predates the rule and sits on the coverage gate's legacy ledger.
   *
   * Both descriptors are `delegated` rather than `generic`, and that is the
   * whole point of them. `generic` is age-only with no status predicate, so it
   * would delete an institution for being OLD — DPRD Kalteng, created once,
   * correct ever since, referenced by thousands of archived articles. What

  /**
   * Reviewed commentable resource contributed to `comments` (ADR-0041). The
   * publication filter is IDENTICAL to the `searchSources` one above and must
   * stay that way: both answer "is this post public right now?", and letting
   * them drift would mean a post is searchable but not commentable (or worse,
   * commentable while unpublished). `comments` reads this through
   * `listModules()`; nothing here imports `comments`.
   *
   * ## Why PAGES are searchable (Issue #625) but not commentable
   *
   * The two lists are deliberately asymmetric, and the asymmetry is the
   * decision rather than an omission. A reader looking for the Pedoman Media
   * Siber should find it — that is what an index is for. A comment thread under
   * the Pedoman Media Siber, the disclaimer or the privacy policy is a different
   * thing: those pages exist because a press council expects to find them
   * stated, and a discussion appended to a published standard reads as
   * qualifying it. Nothing is lost by leaving it off — a page can be given a
   * thread the day a tenant asks for one, and adding it then is one descriptor.
   *
   * So the "filters must be identical" rule above binds POST to POST. It says
   * nothing about which resource types appear in both lists.
