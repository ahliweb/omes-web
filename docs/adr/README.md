# Architecture Decision Records

A record of decisions and the reasoning behind them — written so a proposal already argued and settled does not come back six months later with nobody remembering why it went the way it did.

A change in this repository needs an ADR when it:

- changes the shape of the output (static ↔ server, a URL's shape);
- changes the security posture (a new runtime credential, RLS, CSP);
- adds a runtime dependency or a third-party service;
- reverses one of the decisions below;
- decides an import direction, a data representation, or an embedding strategy that the rest of the codebase is then built to assume.

What does **not** need an ADR: adding a field within an already-decided schema, a routine dependency bump, a test, a copy edit.

## Why the numbering starts at 0001

Unlike `ahliweb/media-lenterakalteng` (whose ADR corpus continues a reference template's own numbering from 0014), this repository's ADR corpus is its own from the start — `apps/cms` carries `ahliweb/awcms`'s own, separate ADR numbering under `apps/cms/docs/adr/`, for its own tree; it is not this index's to continue or to cite by bare number (a citation to one of `apps/cms`'s own ADRs is written with a marker — `awcms`, "reference repo", or a GitHub link in the same paragraph — precisely so [`bun run audit:dokumen`](../../AGENTS.md#the-gates) can tell the two numbering spaces apart).

## This table is guarded

`bun run audit:dokumen` requires it complete in both directions — every ADR file in this directory recorded here, every row pointing at a file that exists — with no duplicate rows, and requires the Status column to agree with the `- **Status:**` line inside the ADR file itself. It runs in CI on every push, needs no build and no network, and — per the correction `media-lenterakalteng`'s own copy of this gate records in its history — the same requirement covers this index's Indonesian mirror, [`README.id.md`](README.id.md): the translation gate's hash keeps that mirror the same AGE as this file, not correct against this directory's actual contents, so `audit:dokumen` checks the mirror's table too, independently.
