/**
 * Toolchain version gate: one Bun version, pinned in three places, and
 * nothing checked it was the same in all three until this file.
 *
 * ## The rule is already written; the checker is what was missing
 *
 * `AGENTS.md`'s "Configuration and toolchain" states it as a rule that
 * cannot be broken: Bun's version moves in `packageManager`/`engines.bun`
 * in the root `package.json` and in `bun-version` in `.github/workflows/
 * ci.yml` TOGETHER. Nothing fails when they drift apart on their own: CI
 * would run one Bun version, a contributor's machine another, and the
 * difference would only be felt as behaviour that cannot be reproduced —
 * exactly the class of defect every gate in this repo exists to catch, and
 * the one this specific rule had no checker for until now.
 *
 * This repo has two CI jobs today (`check`, and `check-cms` since issue
 * #25), so two `bun-version` declarations are expected — the comment this
 * replaced predicted exactly this: "When ... a from-source `apps/cms` CI job
 * lands with its own `bun-version` line, this count should grow with them,
 * deliberately, rather than silently." `check-cms` pins the SAME root
 * version as `check` (not apps/cms's own `1.4.2` — see the next test), so
 * growing the expected count is not enough on its own; every declaration
 * found must still equal the one root version.
