/**
 * `POST /api/v1/data-lifecycle/subject-requests/export` — ADR-0094, Issue #557.
 *
 * Everything this tenant holds about one data subject, assembled from the
 * `subjectData` registry rather than from a hand-written table list.
 *
 * ## Audited as a DISCLOSURE, not as a read
 *
 * ADR-0094 Decision 3: "anyone who can export any subject can exfiltrate the
 * whole user base one request at a time". So the audit row says
 * `subject_data.disclosed` at `critical`, and a durable row lands in
 * `awcms_subject_requests` in the same transaction. A read that left no trace
 * would make that sentence unverifiable.
 *
 * ## The response states its own coverage
 *
 * `unanswered` carries every table the plan deliberately does NOT reach —
 * global (ADR-0094 Decision 1) or matchable by no column — each with the reason
 * its owning module wrote. A subject-access report that is incomplete and does
 * not say so is worse than none, because it is signed.
 *
 * High-risk mutation in the audit sense even though it only reads: it requires
 * `Idempotency-Key`, so a retried disclosure replays rather than producing a
 * second `disclosed` row that reads like a second disclosure.
