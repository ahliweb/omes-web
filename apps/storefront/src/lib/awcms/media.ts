/**
 * The `media_library` read client (issue #47) — batch-resolves a media
 * object id to its public reference (URL, alt text, dimensions, credit), and
 * reads the deployment's media public origin for the CSP artifact
 * (`src/pages/csp.json.ts`). Same discipline as every other file in
 * `src/lib/awcms/`: this is the ONE place that knows a path, a query
 * parameter, or an envelope key for these two resources — everything above
 * it (`src/lib/berita.ts`, `src/lib/portable-text.ts`, then every page) gets
 * a plain, already-resolved `ResolvedMedia` back, never an id it has to
 * chase down itself.
 *
 * ## Every shape below is read from the route/application code, not the
 * issue text alone
 *
 * - `GET /api/v1/media/objects?ids=<uuid>,<uuid>` —
 *   `apps/cms/src/pages/api/v1/media/objects/index.ts`. At most 100 ids per
 *   call (`MAX_IDS` there); a caller that sends more gets a 400, so this
 *   file chunks rather than ever sending more. Envelope: `ok({ items,
 *   unresolved })`, verified field-by-field against `ResolvedMediaReference
 *   DTO` (`_shared/ports/media-library-port.ts`): `publicUrl`, `altText`,
 *   `mimeType`, `width`, `height`, `sizeBytes`, `creditLine`, `sourceName`,
 *   `copyrightStatus`. This app only ever renders `publicUrl`/`altText`/
 *   `width`/`height`/`creditLine`/`sourceName`/`copyrightStatus` — `mimeType`
 *   and `sizeBytes` have no reader here, so `ResolvedMedia` below does not
 *   carry them.
 * - `GET /api/v1/media/public-origin` —
 *   `apps/cms/src/pages/api/v1/media/public-origin.ts`. The ONE verified,
 *   purpose-built source for the media host `src/pages/csp.json.ts` widens
 *   `img-src` with — that route's own docblock explains why reading the
 *   origin off an already-resolved `publicUrl` does not work for a build
 *   with zero images. `configured: false` (an LAN/offline deployment with no
 *   public media bucket) is a real, valid state, not an error — the CSP
 *   artifact simply omits the entry.
 *
 * ## Unresolved ids are rendered as no image, never a broken `<img>`
 *
 * An id that does not resolve (unknown, cross-tenant, soft-deleted, or not
 * yet verified — `apps/cms`'s own docblock) comes back in the route's
 * `unresolved` array. `resolveMedia` below simply omits it from the returned
 * map; every caller (`src/lib/berita.ts`) already treats "not in the map" as
 * "no image", the same degrade `src/lib/awcms/blog.ts`'s ad placements and
 * institutions already use for their own missing-data cases. The FIRST time
 * a given id is reported unresolved, it is logged once (`console.warn`) so a
 * genuinely broken CMS reference is visible in a build log rather than
 * silently swallowed — logged once, not once per call, because the same
 * dangling id can legitimately be referenced by many posts in one build.
 *
 * ## Memoisation
 *
 * A resolved id is cached for the rest of this build — the SAME per-build
 * memoisation shape `src/lib/awcms/blog.ts` uses for its whole-resource
 * fetches, just keyed per id instead of per resource. In practice
 * `src/lib/berita.ts` calls `resolveMedia` exactly once, with every id the
 * whole build's posts reference, batched and chunked here — but the cache
 * makes a second caller (or a second `resolveMedia` call with an overlapping
 * id set) free rather than a silent second network round trip.
