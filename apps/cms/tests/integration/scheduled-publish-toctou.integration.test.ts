/**
 * The scheduled publish sweep evaluates the content quality checklist TWICE,
 * and the second evaluation is the one that decides.
 *
 * ## Why this needs its own file
 *
 * The re-evaluation exists because the post rows are locked by the batch's
 * `FOR UPDATE` and the R2 media objects they reference are NOT: an editor can
 * detach or invalidate a referenced image between the first evaluation and the
 * `UPDATE`. Re-running immediately before the write keeps that window at one
 * query round trip.
 *
 * Every part of that is invisible to the other suites. A budget counts queries
 * and would be just as happy if the second pass were deleted — happier, in
 * fact, since the number would drop. A correctness test that seeds a stable
 * fixture cannot tell the two passes apart, because both see the same media.
 * So the mitigation has always been a comment with nothing holding it, and
 * batching the sweep is exactly the kind of change that would have quietly
 * removed it while looking like a tidy-up: reusing the first pass's verdicts is
 * one line shorter and reads as obviously equivalent.
 *
 * ## How it is proven
 *
 * A `MediaLibraryPort` stub that resolves the post's featured media on the
 * FIRST call and stops resolving on the second — the detachment, made
 * deterministic. Under it the sweep must leave the post `scheduled` and write a
 * blocked audit row. The control case, the same stub resolving every time,
 * must publish: without it, a test that "passes" because the checklist never
 * passed at all would look identical.
 *
 * The stub also answers the enforcement question directly, so this file needs
 * no `NEWS_MEDIA_R2_*` environment at all — the port is the seam, and using it
 * is what makes the media state controllable in the first place.
 *
 * Gated on `DATABASE_URL` (harness §Gating).
