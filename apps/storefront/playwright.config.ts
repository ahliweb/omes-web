/**
 * Playwright config for the top of this app's own testing pyramid
 * (issue #30) — a REAL browser against a REAL `bun run build` output,
 * served by this app's own preview server, talking to the extended
 * `scripts/stub-awcms.mjs` state machine. Run with `bun run test:e2e`.
 *
 * `globalSetup` (`tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`) does the heavy lifting: start
 * the stub, build the site against it with the right env, start the
 * preview server, and return a teardown that stops both — no `webServer`
 * option here, because this app cannot boot with no CMS to build against
 * (the repo's own `playwright` skill: "`webServer` only when the app can
 * boot itself with no external dependency").
