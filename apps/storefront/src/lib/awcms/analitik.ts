/**
 * The `visitor_analytics` read client (issue #49) — the build-time half of
 * the visitor-analytics loop issue #56's beacon (`src/scripts/analitik.ts`,
 * `POST /api/v1/analytics/collect`) feeds: it reads the last seven days'
 * most-viewed paths back out so the news sidebar's "Terpopuler" box can rank
 * real readership rather than restating "latest". Same discipline as every
 * other file in `src/lib/awcms/`: this is the ONE place that knows the
 * route, its query parameter, its permission, and its envelope key —
 * everything above it (`src/components/berita/Sidebar.astro`) gets plain
 * `{ slug, count }` pairs or an already-ranked list of its own posts back.
 *
 * ## The shape below is read from the route file, not the issue text
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/analytics/pages?range=24h|7d|30d|12m` —
 * `apps/cms/src/pages/api/v1/analytics/pages.ts`, gated by
 * `authorizeInTransaction` on `visitor_analytics.dashboard.read`
 * (`DASHBOARD_GUARD` there; the module README's "API" table names the same
 * key for `/summary|pages|devices|locations|security`). `range` defaults to
 * `7d` (`DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_RANGE`, `domain/analytics-range.ts`) — passed
 * explicitly here anyway so this file states the window it asks for rather
 * than inheriting whatever upstream's default becomes. The envelope is
 * `ok({ range, pages })`, where `pages` is `fetchTopPaths`'s `NamedCount[]`
 * (`application/analytics-queries.ts`): `{ name: string; count: number }`,
 * `name` being the event's `path_sanitized` column — human pageviews only
 * (`human_status = 'human'`), top 50 by count. **That 50 is the route's own
 * fixed `limit` (`fetchTopPaths`'s default) and the route takes no limit
 * parameter, and it counts EVERY path on the tenant — the store's product
 * pages, `/`, `/produk`, rubrik indexes — so a post ranked 51st or lower
 * tenant-wide is simply invisible to this ranking and loses the sidebar to
 * a zero-view post the top-up reaches first.** Widening that window is an
 * upstream `visitor_analytics` change, not something this file can ask
 * for; on a store-heavy tenant the practical effect is that "Terpopuler"
 * ranks only the handful of posts that make the overall top 50, topped up
 * with the newest. The build credential needs
 * `visitor_analytics.dashboard.read` — added by name to the seed's
 * storefront token permission set (`tools/seed-borneojek-mart.ts`'s
 * `MACHINE_CREDENTIAL_PERMISSION_KEYS`), the same rule issue #47 followed for
 * `media_library.media.read`.
 *
 * ## `path_sanitized` is a path PLUS its surviving query string
 *
 * `domain/path-sanitizer.ts`'s `sanitizePath` strips only the SENSITIVE
 * query parameters (`token`, `code`, `email`, …) and keeps every other one
 * — so `/berita/x`, `/berita/x?utm_source=wa` and `/berita/x?fbclid=…` are
 * THREE distinct rows in the route's answer, each with its own count. A
 * ranking that took the rows at face value would split one article's
 * readership across however many share links it travelled on and rank a
 * less-read article above it. `hitungTayangPerSlug` below therefore
 * collapses every row to the post slug its path names (`/berita/{slug}` or
 * `/video/{slug}`, query and fragment dropped, one trailing slash tolerated
 * even though this app's `trailingSlash: "never"` never emits one) and SUMS
 * the counts per slug before anything is ranked.
 *
 * ## Falls back to "latest" — silently, and why that is the right call
 *
 * `visitor_analytics` is OFF by default (`VISITOR_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`,
 * `apps/cms`'s own switch — `docs/deployment.md`'s "The two switches"). A
 * deployment that never turned it on, a build credential minted before this
 * permission was added to the seed, a tenant where the module is not
 * enabled, or an older `apps/cms` with no such route at all, all answer a
 * `403` (`MODULE_DISABLED`/`ACCESS_DENIED`) or `404`; a freshly enabled
 * module with no events yet answers `200` with `pages: []`; a site whose
 * traffic all landed on non-post paths maps to nothing. In every one of
 * those cases `pilihTerpopuler` degrades to the newest posts — the exact
 * list `src/lib/berita.ts`'s pre-#49 `getTerpopuler()` always rendered —
 * and the sidebar heading stays "Terpopuler" with NO "sorted by date"
 * caveat in the UI: the issue asks for the fallback to be recorded in code
 * (this comment), not surfaced to a reader, because a caveat there would be
 * a statement about the deployment's configuration, not about the news. The
 * degrade is the same "optional editorial inventory" posture
 * `src/lib/awcms/blog.ts` takes for ad placements; anything OTHER than a
 * 403/404 (5xx, timeout, unreachable) still fails the build loudly, the
 * rule every fetch in this directory follows.
