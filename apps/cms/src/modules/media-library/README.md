# media_library

Tenant-scoped media object registry and upload flow — a System Foundation module
reusable by every website module ([ADR-0036](../../../docs/adr/0036-media-library-module-admission-ownership-inversion.md),
adapting awcms-micro ADR-0026).

## Origin — an ownership inversion, not a fresh port

This module was created by **extracting the media registry out of `news_portal`**.
Before ADR-0036, `news_portal` owned the registry (because the epic that needed
media happened to be the news portal) and exposed it as the `news_media`
capability; a brochure-site tenant (`blog_content` + `tenant_domain`, no news
portal) therefore had no managed media at all.

The coupling lived in the port contract itself
(`NewsMediaPort.isFullOnlineR2ModeActiveForTenant` — a `news_portal` editorial
question), so the port was **split**, not just renamed. `media_library` now owns:

- the registry table `awcms_news_media_objects` (kept its name deliberately — §3
  of the ADR: a hard composite FK from `awcms_news_portal_ad_placements` plus
  three migrations reference it), migrations `041`/`042`/`045`;
- the presigned direct-to-R2 upload/finalize/cancel flow
  (`/api/v1/media/news-images/upload-sessions/*`) with real magic-byte MIME
  sniffing and server-side SHA-256 verification;
- the `news-media:reconcile` background job (command name kept);
- the `media_library` capability (`_shared/ports/media-library-port.ts`,
  `MediaLibraryPort`), consumed by `blog_content` (optional) and `news_portal`
  (required — ad placements FK a media object).

`news_portal` keeps homepage sections + ad placements (and, where ported, the
R2-only editorial preset); it now **consumes** `media_library`.

## Managed-media enforcement (ADR-0036 step 5a) — one-way by construction

"Must this tenant's media references be registry-backed?" is answered by two
halves that both must hold:

1. **Deployment readiness** — `domain/managed-media-readiness.ts`
   (`evaluateManagedMediaReadiness`), pure: R2 enabled, config complete, and
   separated from `sync-storage`'s own `R2_*` credentials. Reason-code strings
   are identical to `news-portal-preset-readiness.ts`'s (the media half was
   carved out of it, and it now composes this).
2. **Per-tenant opt-in** — `application/media-library-tenant-state.ts`
   (`awcms_media_library_tenant_state`, migration `053`, RLS FORCE). The only
   writer is `markManagedMediaEnforced`, called only from the sanctioned entry
   point `application/enable-managed-media-enforcement.ts`, exposed as
   `POST /api/v1/media/enforcement` (permission `media_library.enforcement.enable`).

**Enforcement is one-way.** There is no `disable` action, no unmark function, and
no DELETE against the state table anywhere — a tenant able to switch its own media
validation off is the exploit `sql/043`'s header records as
confirmed-exploitable. The only rollback is a deployment-level `NEWS_MEDIA_R2_*`
change (fail-closed via readiness). Guarded by
`tests/media-enforcement-one-way.test.ts`.

Registry/upload/homepage/ad-placement tables (`041`–`045`) were created before
the inversion and are unchanged.

## Object lifecycle ([ADR-0056](../../../docs/adr/0056-media-library-admin-surface.md) §B)

Three of this module's permissions sat in the catalog since `sql/052`, granted
to every tenant owner, and enforced by **nothing** — no route, no function, no
job. The functions behind them were written and had zero callers. So an object
uploaded by mistake, orphaned, or violating policy disappeared only if the
reconciliation job happened to categorise it that way, on the job's schedule.
There was no way for an administrator to remove one, and no way to undo it.

| Endpoint                                  | Permission                    | Notes                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DELETE /api/v1/media/objects/{id}`       | `media_library.media.delete`  | Body `{ reason }`, required and bounded. Soft delete; R2 untouched. |
| `POST /api/v1/media/objects/{id}/restore` | `media_library.media.restore` | Undo. A live object answers 404, not a silent success.              |
| `POST /api/v1/media/objects/{id}/purge`   | `media_library.media.purge`   | Hard-deletes the REGISTRY ROW only. Cannot be undone.               |

All three are high-risk actions and require `Idempotency-Key`.

**Soft delete breaks live references, deliberately.** `resolveMediaReferences`
filters `deleted_at IS NULL`, so a post whose `featured_media_id` points at a
deleted object resolves to nothing immediately. That is the intended outcome for
the case this exists to serve — a policy-violating image must stop being served
— and `restore` is why it is recoverable. None of these endpoints scans for
referencing rows first: that would make this module know its own consumers.

**`purge` clears the registry, not the bucket.** The `news-media:reconcile` job
owns R2 and has the ordering discipline for deleting from it; a second writer
here would mean two processes with different ideas of what is safe to remove.
Accepted, stated cost: a window where the R2 object outlives its registry row,
closed by the next reconciliation tick, which sees a key with no row and treats
it as an orphan-in-R2.

`awcms_news_portal_ad_placements.media_object_id` is a hard NOT NULL FK here, so
purging a still-referenced object answers `409 MEDIA_OBJECT_REFERENCED`. That
path runs inside a **savepoint**: in PostgreSQL a `23503` aborts the whole
transaction, so catching it without one turns a caller-actionable 409 into a 500
at COMMIT. The SQLSTATE is read from `error.errno` — Bun puts its own constant
on `error.code`, so comparing `code` to `"23503"` can never be true
(`tests/postgres-sqlstate-detection.test.ts` now gates this repo-wide).

## Browse listing ([ADR-0056](../../../docs/adr/0056-media-library-admin-surface.md) §C)

`GET /api/v1/media/objects/list` — gated on `media_library.media.read`, keyset
paginated (50/page), newest first. Filters: `status`, `mimeType`, `deletion`
(`live` | `deleted` | `all`, default `live`), `cursor`.

Before this, the application layer had only point lookups
(`fetchNewsMediaObjectById`, `...ByIds`, `...ByObjectKey`). There was no way to
ask "what media does this tenant have", so a browse screen could not be built on
the existing surface at all, whatever the permissions said.

**A separate path from `GET /api/v1/media/objects`, deliberately.** That
endpoint demands `?ids=` — it is a batch RESOLVER for the `awcms-astro` build.
Teaching it a no-`ids` mode would turn a request that is a **400 today** into a
dump of the whole registry: a contract change wearing the clothes of an
addition. `list` can never be read as an object id, because the `/{id}` routes
require a uuid and answer 400 otherwise — so the static/dynamic precedence rule
is not the only thing keeping the two paths apart.

**It deliberately outgrows the resolver's safety rule**, returning rows in ANY
status and, on request, soft-deleted ones. `isNewsMediaObjectSafeForPublicReference`
admits only `verified`/`attached`; an administrator opens this list precisely
because of the objects that are NOT healthy, and §B's lifecycle endpoints would
otherwise have no way to find their targets. Nothing returned here may be used
as a public reference — that is what the resolver is for.

The cursor carries full-precision `created_at` text, never a JS `Date`. A batch
upload writes many rows inside one millisecond, which is the exact shape of
Issue #158; `tests/integration/media-object-list.integration.test.ts` inserts
107 rows in ONE statement and walks every page, and reverting the cursor to a
`Date` loses 57 of them.

## `/admin/media` ([ADR-0056](../../../docs/adr/0056-media-library-admin-surface.md), ADR-0051)

The object lifecycle console: browse with the §C filters, then delete, restore,
or purge. Four permissions — `media.read`, `.delete`, `.restore`, `.purge`.
Every mutation posts to the guarded endpoint with a fresh `Idempotency-Key`
(unlike `/admin/sync`, where no endpoint wants one, all three here require it).

Three deliberate absences, each pinned by
`tests/admin-media-page-contract.test.ts` so they stay decisions rather than
becoming gaps:

- **Upload** (`media.create`/`.verify`/`.cancel`) — a three-step browser flow
  (create session → PUT to R2 → finalize) with file input, progress, and
  client-side failure modes. A button that starts a session this page cannot
  finish leaves a `pending_upload` row on every misclick, which is exactly the
  litter the reconciliation job cleans up.
- **`enforcement.*`** — a tenant-wide ONE-WAY policy switch, not an object
  action. It lives on `/admin/security` with the other policy controls.
- **No `<img>` preview.** A row can be `pending_upload` or `failed`: the bytes
  may be absent, unverified, or the very thing the operator came to remove.
  Rendering them shows a policy-violating image one more time, to the person
  removing it.

## Not ported to this base (deferred, additive)

Responsive `srcset` render (micro step 5b) and the PDF media type (step 5c).
The allowed MIME set defaults to the four raster types; `image/svg+xml` is an
operator opt-in (see §SVG upload safety below), not a fifth default. Step
5d — the lifecycle API and `/admin/media` — is now ported in full.

## SVG upload safety (Issue #806)

`NEWS_MEDIA_R2_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` (`domain/media-r2-config.ts`) has, since
Issue #635, listed `image/svg+xml` among `NEWS_MEDIA_R2_KNOWN_MIME_TYPES` —
excluded from the _default_ allow-list, but a real opt-in an operator could
already configure. Before this issue that opt-in was a dead end:
`media-mime-sniffer.ts`'s `sniffNewsMediaMimeType` never recognized SVG's
magic bytes at all, so every SVG upload sniffed to `undefined` and was
hard-rejected as `mime_not_recognized` regardless of the allow-list — safe by
accident, not by a real content check, and unusable for the actual use case
(an institution/regency emblem, which is very often an SVG — `blog_content`
Issue #806).

Two additions close that gap, both pure/no-I/O:

- `sniffNewsMediaMimeType` now recognizes SVG's SHAPE — an optional BOM/`<?xml
... ?>` prolog/`<!DOCTYPE ...>`/comments, then a `<svg` root element within
  a bounded byte prefix — returning `"image/svg+xml"`. This is a shape match
  only; it says nothing about whether the SVG is safe to serve.
- `domain/media-svg-safety.ts`'s `findSvgSafetyViolations`/`isSvgContentSafe`
  scans the full decoded bytes for the vectors an executable-XML image format
  actually carries: a `<script>` element, an `on*=` event-handler attribute, a
  `javascript:` URI (in `href`/`xlink:href`/any attribute), a `data:` URI (in
  `href`/`xlink:href`/`src`), an external entity/DOCTYPE
  (`<!DOCTYPE`/`<!ENTITY ... SYSTEM|PUBLIC` — the XXE vector), or ANY
  `<!ENTITY` declaration at all. A targeted denylist, not a general-purpose
  sanitizer: a file tripping any one of them is rejected outright, never
  stripped/rewritten — an institution logo/emblem has no legitimate reason to
  need any of these constructs.

**Three closures added on top of the literal-pattern denylist** (PR #807
review — a denylist over literal patterns is only as strong as its
resistance to the same semantics re-expressed in a form the patterns don't
literally match):

1. **`data:` URI** (`data_uri`) — `<use xlink:href="data:image/svg+xml;
base64,...">`/`<image href="data:image/svg+xml,...">` can carry an entire
   NESTED SVG document (its own `<script>`/`on*=`, invisible to every other
   check here) that a renderer inlining `<use>`/`<image>` references
   evaluates as its own document. Rather than trying to decode-and-recurse
   into every possible data-URI encoding (base64, percent-encoded, ...), ANY
   `data:` scheme in `href`/`xlink:href`/`src` is rejected unconditionally.
2. **Character-reference / control-character obfuscation** —
   `&#106;avascript&#58;...` (decimal), `&#x6A;avascript&#x3A;...` (hex), and
   a bare TAB/LF/CR spliced into the scheme itself (`jav&#x09;ascript:...`,
   which URL parsers treat identically to `javascript:` because they strip
   TAB/LF/CR from the whole string before reading the scheme) all decode/
   normalize to a URI the literal patterns never see in the raw bytes.
   `normalizeForUriChecks` decodes numeric/hex/the five XML-predefined named
   character references, then strips TAB/LF/CR, before the
   `javascript:`/`data:`/`on*=` checks run — `<script>`/entity checks
   deliberately still run against the RAW text, since character references
   are only ever expanded inside attribute values/text content by an XML
   parser, never inside markup syntax itself (decoding first would risk a
   false trip on inert escaped text like `&lt;script&gt;`).
3. **Parameter-entity splitting** (`entity_declaration`) —
   `<!ENTITY % p1 "SYST"><!ENTITY % p2 "EM \"file:///...\"">` never puts the
   literal keyword `SYSTEM`/`PUBLIC` inside any ONE declaration, so the
   keyword-anchored XXE pattern alone misses it (tracing parameter-entity
   expansion is a real XML parser's job, not a regex's). ANY `<!ENTITY`
   declaration at all — parameter or general, keyword or not — is now
   rejected unconditionally.

All three closures follow the same "reject the shape outright" philosophy as
the original four checks, and the same ReDoS-safe linear-scan discipline
`media-mime-sniffer.ts`'s `looksLikeSvg` established (every added regex is a
single bounded quantified class or a fixed literal — CodeQL js/redos was a
real finding on an earlier version of `looksLikeSvg`, so this module was
written to the same standard from the start and is guarded by the same style
of large-adversarial-input timing test).

`application/media-r2-verification.ts` runs the safety scan ONLY when the
sniff already resolved to `image/svg+xml`, on the same bytes already read by
the size-capped `GET` — a raster upload never pays for or is affected by this
check. `domain/media-finalize-decision.ts`'s `decideNewsMediaFinalizeOutcome`
gained a new `svgUnsafe` input and `svg_unsafe_content` rejection reason,
checked after the allow-list/claimed-mime-type checks and before the checksum
claim — an SVG a deployment has not opted into is still rejected
`mime_not_allowed` first, safety-scan result notwithstanding.

Tests: `tests/media-mime-sniffer.test.ts` (shape recognition + ReDoS
regression guards), `tests/media-svg-safety.test.ts` (every vector above,
each of the three closures with a reproduced-bypass-shaped adversarial case,
a linear-time guard on the character-reference decoder, and a safe-logo
control case), `tests/media-finalize-decision.test.ts`/
`tests/media-r2-verification.test.ts` (end-to-end wiring).

## Media reference resolution (`GET /api/v1/media/objects`)

This registry previously had **no read surface at all** — only upload sessions
and the enforcement flag. The consequence was that an out-of-process consumer
could see that a post HAS an image (`featured_media_id`, `seo_image_media_id`)
with no way whatsoever to learn its URL; `article-images.ts` in `awcms-astro`
returned `src: undefined` for exactly that reason, and every article shipped
without its image while nothing failed.

`GET /api/v1/media/objects?ids=<uuid>,<uuid>` resolves at most 100 ids in one
pass (gated on `media_library.media.read` — a permission seeded since `sql/052`
while it waited for its surface, ADR-0026 step 5d). The logic is NOT new:
`MediaLibraryPort.resolveMediaReferences` already does the same thing for
in-process consumers. This is the same call, over HTTP, with the same security
rules — only `verified`/`attached` objects, one tenant, not soft-deleted,
resolve.

Ids that do not resolve are **reported** in `unresolved`, not dropped: returning
only the successful ones makes "this resource has no image" and "its image
reference is broken" the same response — the ambiguity that let this
missing-image gap survive unnoticed. An id that is not a uuid is rejected with
400, because "you sent garbage" and "that object may not be referenced" are two
different facts.

Read-only, so machine credentials ([ADR-0049](../../../docs/adr/0049-machine-credentials-and-session-introspection.md))
may hold it.

### Credit/rights fields on the public DTO (Issue #782)

`sql/137` (Issue #615) gave every media object seven rights fields:
`creditLine`, `sourceName`, `rightsNotes`, `copyrightStatus`,
`rightsVerificationStatus`, `rightsVerifiedBy`, `rightsVerifiedAt`. Until
Issue #782, none of them crossed the `GET /api/v1/media/objects` boundary — a
derived news site could render a photo's alt text with no photographer
credit, even though the credit existed on the row all along.

`ResolvedMediaReferenceDTO` (`_shared/ports/media-library-port.ts`) now also
carries `creditLine`, `sourceName`, and `copyrightStatus` — but **only three
of the seven, and only conditionally**:

- **`rightsVerifiedBy`/`rightsVerifiedAt` never cross at all.** They name an
  internal reviewer and a review moment. Same posture
  [ADR-0109](../../../docs/adr/0109-a-byline-is-opted-into-and-it-is-not-your-account-name.md)
  already took for `awcms_tenant_users.public_byline_name`: an internal
  identity must never reach a public, credential-gated surface as a side
  effect of some other field being published.
- **`rightsNotes` never crosses either.** It can hold licensing terms and
  contact details — editorial-internal, not a credit.
- **`creditLine`/`sourceName`/`copyrightStatus` cross ONLY when
  `rightsVerificationStatus === 'verified'`.** On anything else — the default
  `'unverified'`, or an explicit `'rejected'` — all three come back `null`,
  even when the underlying row has them populated. Fail-closed: nobody has
  confirmed the newsroom may print this credit, so the endpoint does not print
  it either. See `domain/media-rights-policy.ts#resolvePublicMediaRightsFields`
  for the pure gate function and its full rationale, and
  `application/media-library-port-adapter.ts`'s `resolveMediaReferences` for
  where it is applied.

This is a widening of data already returned by an existing
`media_library.media.read`-gated route — no new endpoint, no new permission.

### `media_library.media.adjudicate_rights` — splitting the WRITE side (Issue #794)

Issue #782/PR #791 (above) is what turned `rightsVerificationStatus` from a
purely internal editorial flag into the switch that decides whether
`creditLine`/`sourceName`/`copyrightStatus` become public. Until Issue #794,
`PATCH /api/v1/media/objects/{id}` gated the WHOLE rights-metadata form —
`creditLine`, `sourceName`, `copyrightStatus`, `rightsNotes`, AND
`rightsVerificationStatus` — behind the single permission
`media_library.media.update` (`sql/137`, Issue #615). That meant whoever could
type in a photo credit could also, in the same request, self-attest it
`'verified'` and trigger the public disclosure above — no second reviewer, no
distinct authority, no workflow step. A tenant granting `media.update` to a
routine content-editor role for the everyday task of typing credit lines was,
without anyone deciding it, also granting the authority to publish a name —
possibly a third party's, e.g. a freelance photographer's.

`sql/152` adds a ninth media permission, `media_library.media.adjudicate_rights`,
and `PATCH /api/v1/media/objects/{id}` now requires the permission(s) that
match the SHAPE of the request body:

- A request that does **not** include `rightsVerificationStatus` needs only
  `media.update`, exactly as before — no regression for the routine case.
- A request that includes `rightsVerificationStatus` **and nothing else**
  needs `media.adjudicate_rights` ALONE. `media.update` is deliberately not
  also required: a rights reviewer's whole job is the adjudication, not
  editing the credit line it adjudicates, and requiring both would force a
  tenant to also hand the reviewer role edit rights over fields it has no
  business touching — reintroducing, one level up, the exact coupling this
  split exists to remove.
- A request that includes `rightsVerificationStatus` **together with** a
  routine field needs **both** permissions. Either permission missing denies
  the WHOLE request; there is no partial write.

Neither permission is common to every shape the route accepts (a
status-only reviewer never needs `update`), so the primary `authorize` guard
is the ANY-of array form (`tenant-route.ts`) — allowed once the caller holds
AT LEAST ONE of the two, through the real `authorizeInTransaction` chokepoint,
for every caller, valid body or not. The `handler` then makes the field-
group-specific `authorizeInTransaction` call(s) — one for `update` when the
body touches a routine field, one for `adjudicate_rights` when it touches
`rightsVerificationStatus`, run independently — that decide what the ACTUAL
body needs. (An earlier revision of this route picked the permission with a
function of the parsed body instead; that accidentally matched a carve-out in
`tenant-route.ts` meant for exactly two OTHER routes, letting a caller with an
invalid body skip authorization entirely. See PR #797.)

`media_library.media.adjudicate_rights` is seeded (`sql/152`) with no default
grant beyond the standard new-tenant `owner` catalogue inclusion every
tenant-scope permission gets — the same posture `media.update` itself has had
since `sql/137`. No OTHER role, and no EXISTING tenant's `owner`, receives it
without a deliberate grant (the role editor, or
`bun run identity-access:permissions:backfill --tenant <code>`): this is meant
to be an opt-in grant a tenant consciously makes to a designated "rights
reviewer" role, not something that rides along with every content-editor
grant. `sql/152`'s own header has the full seeding rationale, including why
`scope = 'platform'` (ADR-0052/0053's tool for `idn_admin_regions.dataset.*`)
is the wrong fit here — this permission never crosses a tenant boundary.

**Known scope limit, not a defect:** a tenant's default `owner` role receives
EVERY tenant-scope permission, `media.update` and `media.adjudicate_rights`
both — the same "owner = every permission" invariant every other module's
`owner` grant has always had. So this split protects against a CUSTOM role a
tenant deliberately creates with only one of the two; it does not, and is not
meant to, stop the owner account itself from doing either.

`/admin/media`'s rights-editor form still submits every routine field
unconditionally (Issue #615's original design), but now omits
`rightsVerificationStatus` from the body unless it actually changed from the
value the page rendered — otherwise every save through that form, including
one that only fixed a typo in a credit line, would require
`media.adjudicate_rights` too. The rights-verification `<select>` itself is
disabled for a caller who lacks `adjudicate_rights`, so nobody is invited to
change a decision the endpoint would refuse.
