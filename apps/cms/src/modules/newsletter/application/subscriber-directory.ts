 * none opens its own transaction, matching every other directory here.
 *
 * ## Nothing in this file returns a token
 *
 * The two tokens are bearer credentials. `subscribe` hands its caller the raw
 * confirmation token exactly once — the caller's only legitimate use for it is
 * putting it in the mail it is about to send — and nothing else ever reads one
 * back out. The admin list does not select them at all.
 *
 * ## Audit records the MASKED address
 *
 * An audit row outlives the subscriber it describes, including past an erasure
 * request. Writing the full address into it would make the audit trail a second
 * copy of the list that subject-rights erasure does not reach.

 * it in one statement makes the race impossible instead of unlikely.
 *
 * ## A suppressed row is left completely alone
 *
 * The `WHERE` on the upsert refuses to touch it — ADR-0103's reason for four
 * states. Re-subscribing must not be a way to clear a suppression somebody
 * applied for abuse, and doing it here rather than in a caller means no future
 * caller can forget.
 *
 * ## A second confirmation to the same address waits for the cooldown
 *
 * The route's rate limiter is keyed on the client IP, so it bounds how fast one
 * SENDER can submit. It cannot bound how much mail one RECIPIENT receives: the
 * person being mailed contributes no IP to the request, and anyone willing to
 * rotate addresses could make this deployment mail-bomb a stranger — in its own
 * name, on its own sending reputation. `confirmationCooldownSeconds` is the
 * ceiling on the other axis, and the two are not substitutes for one another.
 *
 * It is a predicate on the upsert rather than a read-then-write for the same
 * reason the whole statement is one statement: two concurrent submissions for
 * one address would both read a stale `confirmation_sent_at` and both send.
 *
 * ## The caller cannot tell which branch ran
 *
 * A new row, a re-subscribe, an already-active address, a suppressed one and an
 * address inside its cooldown all return the same SHAPE, and the endpoint
 * answers the same body for all five. That is what stops the public endpoint
 * being an enumeration oracle — and it is why the cooldown had to join the
 * existing silent branches instead of introducing an answer of its own.
