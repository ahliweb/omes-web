 *
 * ## It returns the ARRAY, not `JSON.stringify` of it
 *
 * Bun JSON-ENCODES a string parameter bound to a jsonb slot, so
 * `${JSON.stringify(x)}::jsonb` compares against the jsonb SCALAR STRING
 * `"[{...}]"` rather than the array. Nothing errors — `@>` against a scalar
 * string simply matches nothing — so the filter silently returns an empty
 * result set and the facet counts beside it quietly go to zero. Passing the JS
 * value itself is what produces a real jsonb array. The same rule governs how
 * `search-index-engine.ts` WRITES the column; there the `sql/140` CHECK turns
 * the mistake into an error instead of a silence.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is nothing to filter by, so every caller can pass
 * the result straight into the same `IS NULL OR` shape the other optional
 * predicates use — and so an empty filter set never becomes `@> '[]'`, which is

/**
 * Counts the facets for one query (Issue #607 for content type, #633 for terms).
 *
 * ## A facet's own filter is never applied to its own count
 *
 * A facet count answers "what ELSE is there", so it must be computed over the
 * result set BEFORE that facet narrows it. Applying `resourceType` to the type
 * counts would make every other count zero the moment a reader picks one — and a
 * reader looking at a list of zeroes has no way back to the results they can
 * still see, because the interface has stopped telling them those results exist.
 *
 * The rule generalizes once there is more than one facet, and generalizing it is
 * what makes this function longer than a single query:
 *
 *   - the TYPE counts apply every term filter but not `resourceType`;
 *   - a term facet the reader has NOT filtered on applies everything, so all
 *     such facets share one query;
 *   - a term facet the reader HAS filtered on needs its own pass with only its
 *     own filter removed — which is why there is one extra query per active term
 *     filter, and no way to fold them into the first.
 *
 * Every other predicate is shared with `searchSiteContent`, character for
 * character: same tenant, same locale, same `websearch_to_tsquery`, same
 * admitted-type allow-list. A facet count derived from a wider predicate than
 * the results would advertise documents the reader cannot reach.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot become a cross-tenant oracle
 *
 * The explicit `tenant_id` predicate and RLS FORCE both bind it, the same
 * defence in depth every query in this repo carries. That matters more here than
 * for a result list: a COUNT leaks the existence of content without displaying
 * it, so a facet that escaped its tenant would be a disclosure with nothing on
 * screen to notice it by. `tests/integration/site-search.integration.test.ts`
 * asserts it negatively against a real database, for term facets as well as
 * type — the term facets get their OWN negative test rather than inheriting the
 * type facet's assumption.
