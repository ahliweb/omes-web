# Part 14 — UI/UX Design System and Screen Specifications

> **Document status (2026-09-02):** **No ERP module code has been implemented yet** ([ADR-0001](../adr/0001-rebuild-on-awcms-foundation-erp-scope.md)) — the ledger/purchase-order/payroll screens below remain a target architecture. Everything that is not ERP-specific **is live in this repo and describes running code**: the design tokens, the admin shell and its header band, the five auth screens, the state pattern, theming, and i18n. Two sections are labelled where they diverge — there is still no `src/components/ui` component library (screens use shared CSS classes instead), and the client error-code map described under i18n does not exist. Sections that say "planned" mean it; sections that do not, do not.

## Purpose

This document defines the AWCMS **UI/UX design** requirements that will complement the operational SOP and the module blueprint when they are written. It covers design principles, design tokens, the component library, information architecture, screen specifications (wireframes), state patterns, accessibility, i18n, and theming — so that the ERP frontend can be implemented consistently from the first module onwards.

Related: `15_frontend_architecture_integration.md` (architecture & wiring), the operational SOP document (to follow). The enforcing skills: **`awcms-ui-screen`** (building a screen) and **`awcms-ux-review`** (auditing one), both in `.claude/skills/`.

## UI/UX design principles

1. **Offline-first is visible** — connection & sync status is always clear; actions still work while offline (e.g. warehouse stock entry with no LAN connection).
2. **Keyboard-first for high-volume entry operators** — every journal entry/warehouse cashier/stock count action can be done without a mouse.
3. **Role-aware** — navigation & actions follow permissions (not the primary control; the backend still validates RBAC/ABAC).
4. **Explicit state** — every screen has a loading, empty, error, and success state.
5. **Safe** — never shows sensitive data in full (salary, bank account, NPWP); follows the data masking rules.
6. **Accessible** — targets WCAG 2.1 AA, sufficient contrast, visible focus, keyboard navigation.
7. **Responsive** — admin/back-office desktop-first, field entry (warehouse/production) fullscreen-tablet, vendor/employee portal mobile-first.
8. **Consistent** — every screen uses the same tokens & components across all ERP modules (finance, inventory, procurement, manufacturing, HR/payroll).

## Design tokens

Tokens are implemented as CSS custom properties, scoped to `:root` and overridden via `:root[data-theme="dark"]`. The values below are **brand-neutral placeholders** that a tenant's brand may replace.

> **One hue, three roles ([ADR-0120](../adr/0120-the-admin-redesign-splits-one-hue-into-three-roles.md)).** A semantic colour carries up to three values, because the contrast arithmetic differs by what it sits on:
>
> | Family      | Job                                         | Used by                                |
> | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
> | `--color-X` | text/icon/border on `--color-surface`       | links; the outlined `.btn-danger`      |
> | `-strong`   | solid fill under `--color-primary-contrast` | `.btn-primary`; the topbar avatar disc |
> | `-on-soft`  | text on `--color-X-soft`                    | status badges; the active sidebar link |
>
> Using the wrong one of the three is the single most-repeated defect in this repo's UI history — Issue #434, PR #720, and twice more during the ADR-0120 redesign. **It is no longer a matter of remembering.** `bun run design:token-contrast:check` (part of `bun run check`) measures a registry of 33 pairs across both themes and fails below WCAG 2.1 AA. Adding a pairing to CSS means adding a line to that registry.
>
> `--color-border` vs `--color-border-strong` is the same split applied to lines. WCAG 2.1 **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast** requires 3:1 for a boundary that identifies an operable component; `--color-border` measures 1.29:1 and deliberately stays that way, because 1.4.11 governs controls, not decorative separators. Inputs, selects, textareas and the search shell use `--color-border-strong`; card edges and table rules use `--color-border`.

### Sidebar tokens (always dark — awcms-one#170)

The admin sidebar rail is a FOURTH colour family, `--color-sidebar-*`, deliberately independent of `data-theme`: it renders one dark navigation surface whether the rest of the admin is in light or dark theme, so it does not flip between `:root` and `:root[data-theme="dark"]` the way every token above does (both blocks declare the same values — see `tokens.css`'s own comment on why that is stated rather than left to inherit).

| Token                         | Value     | Function                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-sidebar-bg`          | `#101722` | Rail background                                                         |
| `--color-sidebar-surface`     | `#1a222e` | Raised block on the rail (the status card)                              |
| `--color-sidebar-border`      | `#1f2733` | Rail's own outer border/rule                                            |
| `--color-sidebar-card-border` | `#2a323c` | Border of a raised block on the rail                                    |
| `--color-sidebar-text`        | `#9aa7b2` | Nav item text on `--color-sidebar-bg`                                   |
| `--color-sidebar-text-strong` | `#f0f4f9` | Brand wordmark, active nav item text                                    |
| `--color-sidebar-text-faint`  | `#838d99` | Group labels — see below for why this is not the mockup's literal value |
| `--color-sidebar-active`      | `#1e2836` | Active nav item background                                              |
| `--color-sidebar-badge`       | `#2b3444` | Count badge background                                                  |

`--color-sidebar-text-faint` is **not** the redesign reference's literal `#6b7581`: measured against both surfaces the token actually sits behind, that value is 3.84:1 on `--color-sidebar-bg` and 3.42:1 on `--color-sidebar-surface`, below the 4.5:1 WCAG 2.1 AA bar this same page already promises — the uppercase group labels it colours carry information, not decoration. `#838d99` keeps the same blue-grey hue and clears both (5.34:1 / 4.75:1), the same correction this design system has already made for the theme-aware families above.

> **The typeface is self-hosted, and that is a CSP requirement rather than a preference.** This repo's `default-src 'self'` policy names no `font-src` or `style-src`, so both fall through to it and `fonts.googleapis.com`/`fonts.gstatic.com` are blocked with no visible error on the page. Five latin/latin-ext `woff2` subsets live in `public/fonts/` (104,004 B), are `unicode-range`-gated, and are measured against their own `FONT_BUDGET_BYTES` in `scripts/client-asset-budget.ts`. A public content page loads none of them — `css/public-content.css` declares no `@font-face`. The system stack stays behind them and is what renders during `font-display: swap` and on a LAN/offline deployment whose font files fail.

### Theming

  Resolve --> Attr[data-theme on html]
  Attr --> Tokens[Active CSS variables]

```

The planned rules: default `system`; the personal per-browser choice is stored in localStorage (it always wins when present) with a fallback to the tenant preference `awcms_tenants.default_theme` (changeable by an admin at `/admin/settings`) for browsers that have never chosen; `data-theme` is set on `<html>` before paint to prevent a flash.

### Motion & animation

The motion system lives in `src/styles/motion.css` (imported globally): the duration tokens `--motion-instant/fast/base/slow` (80/140/240/400ms) + the easings `--ease-standard/out/in/spring`, keyframes prefixed with `awcms-` (`awcms-fade-in`, `awcms-fade-in-up`, `awcms-scale-in`, `awcms-slide-in-left`, etc.), and their matching utility classes (`.fade-in-up`, `.scale-in`, `.hover-lift`, `.transition-base`, `.skeleton`). Animation = micro-interaction: subtle, fast, clarifying a state change — not a performance.

Rules:

- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` MUST be honoured** — `motion.css` already neutralises its motion utilities in the reduced-motion block. That block targets the utility classes (not `*`), so a new animation that is **scoped** to a single page/component must carry its own local reduced-motion guard.
- **No layout shift** — animate only `opacity`/`transform`/colour/`box-shadow`, never `width`/`height`/`top`/`left`.
- **The entrance of main content that is already visible at SSR should be `transform`-only (e.g. `translateY`), not from `opacity: 0`.** An axe-core scan can read half-transparent text mid-animation as a contrast violation if it happens to scan before the animation finishes. The login card (`login.astro`) uses `@keyframes auth-card-rise` (translateY-only) as the canonical example. An `opacity:0` fade (e.g. the `.fade-in-up` utility) is still fine for elements revealed **after** load (post-action banners/dialogs) or for secondary elements — avoid it only for the main text content of auth/entry screens.

## Component library

The base components are planned to live in `src/components/ui`, used across personas and across ERP modules.

| Dialog / Drawer                           | focus trapped, `Esc` closes — a native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`, which supplies the focus trap, Esc-to-close, inertness, the backdrop and focus restore without a line of script. The **command palette** (`src/lib/ui/admin-command-palette.ts`, ADR-0120) is the worked example in this repo; confirming destructive actions is still `window.confirm` and is the next thing to move. The admin sidebar itself (mobile drawer) is NOT a `<dialog>` — it stays a static `<nav>` on desktop, its focus trap written by hand. |

| Badge / StatusPill                        | colour-coded lifecycle status (draft/pending approval/posted/rejected/void/quarantine) — `success/warning/danger/info/neutral` variants. Since [ADR-0120](../adr/0120-the-admin-redesign-splits-one-hue-into-three-roles.md) the shipped `.status-badge` is a **tint** badge: `--color-X-soft` fill with `--color-X-on-soft` text.

The non-visual client helper `src/lib/ui/admin-form-client.ts` **exists and is shared by the `<script>` of every admin screen** for fetch + message + anti-double-submit. Its real surface is `onSubmit`/`onSubmitAll`/`onAction`/`mutateAndReload` (the wiring), `sendJson`/`sendJsonRequest`/`sendJsonForData` (the request), `lockElement` + `messageBox` (the feedback), and the field readers `field`/`inputValue`/`blankToNull`/`checkboxChecked`/`integerValue`/`localDateTimeToInstant`. **Read the exports before writing against it** — `grep -n "^export" src/lib/ui/admin-form-client.ts` — because earlier revisions of this document named a `submitJson`/`showBanner` pair that never existed, and several skills still tell you to call `postJson`, which was **deleted on 22 August 2026** (PROJECT_STATE D12 — zero callers, and a docblock claiming otherwise).

Importing from this module is mandatory rather than merely DRY: under `default-src 'self'` Astro inlines an import-free `<script>` and the CSP then blocks it silently, while a script that imports from this module is bundled to an external `/_astro/*.js` that `'self'` permits.

### Incremental migration of large screens (a pattern, not a status)

When a large ERP admin screen (e.g. journal entry, a multi-line purchase order form) is implemented, follow the atomic-per-issue pattern proven in awcms-mini: build it directly out of the primitives above (`DataTable`, `StatusBadge`, `ActionBanner`, `FormField`, `ConfirmDialog`) instead of ad-hoc markup, and migrate old screens one at a time if any exist — do not do a full redesign all at once. The SSR-read-directly/mutation-through-the-API pattern (doc 15) is not changed by a markup/CSS/client-script migration.

## Information architecture (role-aware navigation)

### Auth screen (login) — split panel, mobile-first

`src/pages/login.astro` is the **canonical** public auth screen pattern (UI/UX overhaul, Issue #166/#215; split panel added by [ADR-0120](../adr/0120-the-admin-redesign-splits-one-hue-into-three-roles.md)). All **five** public auth screens — `login`, `register`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`, `accept-invitation` — share it: `<main class="auth">` is a two-column grid at ≥900px holding `AuthBrandPanel.astro` and an `.auth-form-panel` wrapping the `.auth-card`.

        ↑ collapses away entirely below 900px
```

The brand half is **`aria-hidden="true"` and carries no information that is not also in the form half.** It is decoration that happens to be large; a screen reader that read it would announce the product name twice before reaching the first field. Below 900px it is not rendered at all rather than stacked above the card, because someone who came to sign in on a phone should reach the first field without scrolling. Its footer prints `Astro.url.host`, so a deployment identifies itself without a config value that could drift from the URL people actually typed.

Its gradient uses **literal colours rather than surface tokens**, deliberately: it is a brand surface, not a UI surface, and it must look the same in both themes. `--color-*` tokens flip with `data-theme`; a brand panel that inverted with the OS preference would be a different brand at night.

Pattern rules (already implemented — follow them, do not regress):

- **Stable DOM contract** (do not rename — the client script + the E2E spec `tests/e2e/login.e2e.ts` depend on it): `#login-form`, `#tenant-id`, `#login-identifier`, `#password`, `#login-submit`, `#login-error`. The tenant field is ALWAYS `id="tenant-id"` + `name="tenantId"` in all three of its shapes so that the submit (`FormData`) keeps working and the `X-AWCMS-Tenant-ID` header is still sent.
- **Adaptive tenant field** (`awcms_tenants` = the RLS-free root table, read SSR read-only without a tenant context, bounded by `TENANT_PICKER_LIMIT`): 0 rows / DB error / > limit → a manual text input (backwards-compatible + avoids mass tenant enumeration); exactly 1 → a read-only "Signing in to <name>" readout (`.auth-tenant-context`) + a hidden `#tenant-id`; 2..limit → a `<select>` of tenant names (value = UUID). Rendering tenant names to an unauthenticated visitor when count > 1 is an accepted product decision for the base repo (the query is bounded + read-only).
- **The show/hide password toggle** is wired in the bundled MODULE script (not an inline `onclick` — the CSP is `default-src 'self'` without `'unsafe-inline'`), with `aria-pressed` + `aria-label` that change when the state changes.
- **Custom select**: the caret is drawn via CSS (`.auth-select::after`, a border trick), not a `data:` URI SVG — staying CSP-safe; the native `<select>` is still used.
- **Card entrance** `@keyframes auth-card-rise` = `transform`-only (translateY), NOT the `.fade-in-up` utility which starts from `opacity:0` (see §Motion — avoid axe contrast flags on main text). Include a local reduced-motion guard.
- **Strict CSP (single-owner)**: `tokens.css`/`motion.css` + the scoped `<style>` are all emitted as external same-origin `<link>`s (`build.inlineStylesheets: "never"`, `astro.config.mjs`); the login script is a bundled module (not `is:inline`); the only `is:inline` `<script src>` is the Cloudflare Turnstile loader, and only when `isTurnstileRequired()` (`src/lib/security/turnstile.ts`).
- **i18n**: the strings on these five screens are still literal English. That is a real remaining gap, not a plan waiting on tooling — the catalogues exist (§Internationalization) and `i18n:screens:check` covers `/admin/*` rather than the public auth pages, so nothing measures this. Translating them means adding the sentences to `locales/*.po` and wrapping them; do it in one pass per page, and prefer doing all five together so the wording stays consistent.

```

**The shell owns the page title** ([ADR-0120](../adr/0120-the-admin-redesign-splits-one-hue-into-three-roles.md)). `AdminLayout.astro` renders the whole `.admin-page-head` band — breadcrumb, `<h1>`, description, and a `page-actions` slot for the screen's own primary button. **A screen must not render its own `<h1>` or its own `<header class="page-header">`.** Before this, all 45 such screens printed their name twice, once from the layout's `title` prop and once from their own heading — and for 20 of them the two were in different languages, because the prop was literal English while the heading went through `t()`.

- `title` (required) is the `<h1>` and the last breadcrumb crumb.
- `description` (optional) or the `page-description` slot fills the line beneath it; the slot exists for the screens whose description contains a link or a `<code>`.
- `breadcrumb` (optional) overrides the middle crumb, which is otherwise **derived** from the composed sidebar — `composeSidebarSections` already knows which entry is current, and asking 45 pages to name their own section would recreate exactly the drift the removed `active` prop caused.

**Sidebar sections collapse** via `<details open>`/`<summary>` — no script, which under this CSP is strictly better, and `<details>` brings the implicit `aria-expanded`, the keyboard behaviour and the disclosure semantics for free. The open state is deliberately **not** remembered: a section that came back collapsed would hide screens from someone who does not know it collapses. Each link carries an icon resolved from `ModuleDescriptor.navigation[].icon`, falling back to a `labelKey`-keyed default table (`sidebar-menu.ts`); path data is a frozen map in `src/lib/ui/admin-icons.ts` and an unknown name renders a neutral dot rather than being echoed into an SVG attribute.

**The command palette** (`Ctrl`/`⌘`+`K`, or the topbar search shell) is a native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`. It filters **the nav entries already rendered into the page** — so it structurally cannot surface a screen the sidebar would not, rather than relying on a second permission check staying in sync with the first. No fetch, 1,369 B.

**Desktop collapse**: at ≥1024px the same `#admin-nav-toggle` checkbox that drives the mobile drawer instead collapses the sidebar to zero width, so a dense table can have the full viewport. One control, two behaviours, no script.

**Responsive**: below `--bp-md` (768px), the sidebar turns into an off-canvas drawer — **CSS-only**, driven by a visually hidden but keyboard-focusable checkbox (`#admin-nav-toggle`) whose `<label>` is the topbar hamburger; a second `<label>` is the scrim that closes it on tap. Nothing to be blocked by CSP, and nothing to fail if a bundle does not load. The closed drawer is `visibility: hidden`, which is what takes its links out of the tab order — `transform` alone would leave them focusable behind the page.

The cost of choosing CSS is stated plainly: there is **no `Esc`-to-close and no focus trap** on this drawer, because both require script. That is acceptable for a nav drawer whose links are all still reachable and whose scrim is a large tap target; it would not be acceptable for a modal that takes input, which is why the command palette is a real `<dialog>` instead. The skip link (`.skip-link`) and `aria-current="page"` on the active link are consistent at both breakpoints. At `--bp-md` and above, the sidebar is static, and the same toggle takes on its desktop-collapse meaning at ≥1024px.

**Tenant badge, not a tenant switcher**: the topbar shows `TenantBadge.astro` — a non-interactive badge (`<div role="status">`) on a single-tenant deployment, NOT a dropdown control that looks active but is `disabled`. The reason: a REAL switcher control may only be rendered when `availableTenants` (a component prop) holds a list computed SERVER-side from real authorization data — showing an interactive control (even a disabled one) without a genuine tenant-switch capability would imply a security capability that does not exist and is not checked anywhere, violating the acceptance criterion "No authorization decision relies on hidden/disabled UI alone".

## Mandatory state pattern

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Loading
  Loading --> Empty: no data
  Loading --> Ready: data present
  Loading --> Error: failed
  Ready --> Submitting: mutation action
  Submitting --> Ready: success (toast)
  Submitting --> Error: failed (safe message)
  Error --> Loading: retry
```

- **Loading**: a skeleton, not an empty spinner, for lists.
- **Empty**: a message + call-to-action (e.g. "No purchase orders yet. Create a new PO").
- **Error**: a user-friendly message (map the standard error codes), without technical details.
- **Optimistic**: operational entry rows (e.g. goods receipt) update instantly; roll back if the server rejects.
- **Offline**: banner + queue; the action is still stored locally (doc 15).
- **Archived/deleted**: the list hides the items by default; a permitted role can open the archive filter, see the `Archived` badge, and run a restore.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **1.4.3 Contrast (text)** — at least 4.5:1. Do not check this by eye or by reasoning about the tokens: run `bun run design:token-contrast:check`, which measures a registry of 25 pairs across both themes and is part of `bun run check`. Picking the wrong one of `--color-X` / `-strong` / `-on-soft` is the most-repeated UI defect in this repo's history (Issue #434, PR #720, and twice more in ADR-0120), and every one of those four was written by someone who had read this line.
- **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (controls)** — 3:1 for the boundary that identifies an operable component. Inputs, selects, textareas and the search shell use `--color-border-strong`; an input's fill differs from the card behind it by 1.03:1, so that border is the only thing saying where the field is. `--color-border` (1.29:1) is for decorative separators only — card edges and table rules — and stays a hairline on purpose.
- Every control is focusable & keyboard-operable; the tab order is logical.
- The focus ring is visible (`--color-focus`); never `outline:none` without a replacement.
- Explicit labels for every input; errors are announced (`aria-live`).
- Dialogs trap focus; `Esc` closes; focus returns to the trigger. Prefer a native `<dialog>` + `showModal()`, which gives all three plus page inertness and the backdrop with no script.
- **Target size.** Touch targets ≥ 44px on the mobile portal and on genuinely touch-first controls (the nav toggle, the drawer links), which say so where they are defined. Admin form controls are **38px** since ADR-0120: WCAG 2.2 AA (2.5.8) asks 24px, this is a pointer-first back-office, and 44px inputs beside 36px buttons made every filter bar look mis-set. That is a deliberate trade, not an oversight — do not "restore" it to 44 without changing the buttons too.
- Do not rely on colour alone for status (add an icon/text).
- Show/hide password toggle: `aria-pressed` + `aria-label` that follow the state, wired via `addEventListener` (not an inline `onclick` — the CSP is `default-src 'self'`). Example: `login.astro` `#password-toggle`.
- Custom controls that hide the native one (e.g. a styled `<select>`): draw the affordance (caret) via CSS `::after`, not a `data:` URI; the native `<select>` is still used so the built-in keyboard + a11y behaviour remains.

## Internationalization (i18n)

> **Status: implemented** ([ADR-0095](../adr/0095-the-interface-speaks-the-readers-language.md)) — a pure `.po` parser with no dependencies, compiled catalogues, `t()`/`tn()`/`tx()`, locale resolution in the middleware, and locale-aware formatters. This banner previously read "not yet implemented in this repo" and named an `i18n/` directory that has never existed; it aged in the opposite direction for long enough that the paragraphs below still describe a pipeline that was designed and then built differently. **Trust the script names in `package.json` over any prose here.**

i18n uses **two separate layers** according to the source of the text:

**1. Static UI strings** (application chrome: labels, buttons, titles, error messages, navigation) → **gettext `.po` catalogue files in `locales/`**, bundled with the application, not in the database. One file per locale (`en.po`, `id.po`); there is **no `.pot` template** and no extraction step. The **msgid is the English source string itself** (`t("Skip to main content")`), not a `namespace.key` — so an untranslated locale degrades to readable English rather than to `auth.login.submit`, and a reviewer reads the sentence in the diff. Every UI string goes through `t()` / `tn()` (plural) / `tx()` (context).

**2. User-entered data** (content typed by users that must appear in multiple languages, e.g. product descriptions/approval notes) → stored **in the database for every active locale** (one value per active language), **not** in `.po`. The per-language storage pattern will be documented in `docs/awcms/04_erd_data_dictionary.md` §Multi-language content (once written). `.po` is only for the developers' static text, the DB is for dynamic user content.

- **Minimum locales**: **en** and **id** (the architecture is ready for ms/ar — the `default_locale` column stays free `text`, not an `enum`/`CHECK`, so ms/ar can be added without a schema migration; the UI only shows locales that actually have a catalogue). **Default = `en`** (`awcms_tenants.default_locale`).
- **Locale resolution**: the `awcms_locale` cookie (set by the language switcher) → the tenant's `default_locale` → fallback `en`. Resolved in `src/middleware.ts` **before** any `/admin/*` page renders — not inside the layout, because a page's frontmatter runs before the frontmatter of the layout that wraps it.
- **Cookie, not localStorage**: unlike the theme toggle (pure CSS, which can be "fixed up" on the client before paint), the locale changes text that has already been SSR-rendered — the server must know the locale **before** rendering, and only a cookie is sent along with the request.
- **The language switcher** (`LanguageSwitcher.astro`) shows a **flag icon** per language + that language's own native name, not translated into the active locale (e.g. 🇬🇧 English, 🇮🇩 Bahasa Indonesia); choosing one sets the cookie and then does a full reload (not an instant swap like the theme).
- **Error messages, and the seam that is still open.** There is no `src/lib/i18n/error-messages.ts` and no injected `{code: message}` map — an earlier revision of this document described both as if they existed. What screens actually do is map `errorCode` to text **per screen**, inline (`blog-ads.astro`, `blog-homepage.astro`), which means the same code can read differently on two screens and a new code is easy to leave unhandled. The catalogue itself is a server module, so client code genuinely cannot reach it; the pattern that works today is the one `AdminLayout` uses for its own script — pass the translated string down as a `data-*` attribute. A central map is worth building; do not describe it as built.
- **Local formatting**: numbers/currency (IDR + locale-appropriate thousands separators) and dates (`Asia/Jakarta`, `Intl.DateTimeFormat`/`NumberFormat`) are locale-aware — `src/lib/i18n/format.ts`.

### Compilation, coverage, and the two gates

The catalogues are **hand-maintained and machine-verified** — the reverse of the extraction pipeline this section used to describe. `bun run i18n:compile` turns each `locales/*.po` into a `src/lib/i18n/catalogs/*.generated.ts` that the server imports; nothing parses `.po` at request time.

**Adding a new UI string:**

1. Use `t("The English sentence")` — or `tn()` for a count, `tx()` when the same English word needs two translations by context.
2. Add the `msgid`/`msgstr` pair to `locales/en.po` **and** `locales/id.po`. There is nothing to extract; the gate below is what tells you if you forgot.
3. Run `bun run i18n:compile` and commit the regenerated `catalogs/*.generated.ts` alongside the `.po` files.

**Two gates, deliberately separate** ([ADR-0095](../adr/0095-the-interface-speaks-the-readers-language.md)):

- `bun run i18n:catalog:check` — **consistency.** Recompiles every `.po` and compares bytes (so a `.generated.ts` cannot drift from its source); asserts every msgid the code asks for is declared; checks each catalogue's `nplurals` against the code's plural table; checks placeholder parity between msgid and msgstr; and reports the still-untranslated `id` count against a ledger that **may only shrink**.
- `bun run i18n:screens:check` — **coverage.** Finds admin screens still rendering literal English text nodes, against its own shrink-only ledger of named screens. A new screen cannot join a list that never grows.

Fusing the two would produce a gate that is green while every answer it gives is wrong; both scripts' headers say so at length.

What the coverage gate deliberately does **not** scan: attributes. `aria-label="Close"` needs translating just as much, but `class="admin-card"` looks identical to the scanner, and a gate that reports class names trains its readers to ignore it. So a screen that passes may still have an untranslated `placeholder` or `aria-label` — check those by hand.

**Plural forms are implemented**, not deferred: `tn()` plus a `PLURAL_FORM_COUNT` table in `src/lib/i18n/locales.ts`. Indonesian declares `nplurals=1` because it does not inflect for number; the `plural=` expression in a `.po` header is read to be **verified, never evaluated**.

## UI/UX acceptance criteria

- Design tokens installed & light/dark/system theming with no flash.
- Base components available with loading/disabled/error states.
- The admin shell, the fullscreen operational entry screen, and the external portal render according to the layouts.
- Every list/detail has a loading/empty/error state.
- Navigation is permission-filtered; the endpoints stay protected by ABAC.
- The operational entry screen can be fully operated via keyboard.
- Contrast & focus meet AA — **demonstrated by `bun run design:token-contrast:check` passing**, plus an axe pass in a real browser for anything the token registry cannot see (opacity, gradients, images behind text). A pairing added to CSS with no line in that registry is not measured; adding the line is part of adding the rule.
- No screen renders its own `<h1>`; the title, description and primary action go through `AdminLayout`'s header band and its `page-actions` slot.
- All strings go through i18n; numbers/currency/dates are locally formatted.
- Sensitive data is displayed masked according to role.
- Soft-deleted resources do not appear in the default list/search; the archive filter and restore only appear when the effective permissions allow it.
