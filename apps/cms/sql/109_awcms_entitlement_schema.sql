-- Gelombang 5 PR 5.1 (Issue #423), ADR-0084 — an entitlement is a structural
-- deny, never a grant.
--
-- Five tables. Three GLOBAL and read-only at runtime (the operator's catalogue,
-- shaped exactly like `awcms_permissions`), two tenant-scoped under FORCE RLS
-- (what a particular customer actually holds).
--
--   awcms_entitlements        global   the names that may be required at all
--   awcms_plans               global   the packages an operator sells
--   awcms_plan_entitlements   global   which package contains which name
--   awcms_tenant_subscriptions tenant  which package this customer is on
--   awcms_tenant_entitlements  tenant  what this customer holds regardless
--
-- ## Why the catalogue is global AND unwritable at runtime
--
-- `awcms_permissions` is the precedent for a global catalogue, and it is a
-- precedent with a specific property worth copying: `GLOBAL_TABLE_FORBIDDEN_
-- PRIVILEGES` forbids `awcms_app` every write verb on it, so no request path can
-- invent a permission. The same reasoning applies here with more force. A plan
-- is the thing that decides what a customer may reach; a request path able to
-- INSERT a row into `awcms_plan_entitlements` is a request path able to award
-- itself a feature, and no RLS policy would object because these tables have no
-- tenant column to police. Making them read-only at runtime removes that class
-- entirely rather than defending against it.
--
-- The cost is stated rather than hidden: creating or repricing a plan is a
-- MIGRATION, not an admin screen. That is the right shape for this repo — a
-- template whose plan catalogue is a deployment artefact — and it is the reason
-- `/admin/subscriptions` (PR 5.4) will assign a tenant to a plan without ever
-- being able to change what a plan contains.
--
-- ## Why the tenant side is two tables and not one
--
-- `awcms_tenant_subscriptions` answers "what is this customer paying for"; it
-- moves on a billing clock and PR 5.2's transition engine is its only writer.
-- `awcms_tenant_entitlements` answers "what does this customer hold" and moves
-- for reasons that are not billing at all: a grandfathered feature, a migration
-- promise, a support concession.
--
-- Collapsing them would make grandfathering (PR 5.3) indistinguishable from
-- paying, so a plan downgrade would silently revoke a promise nobody recorded
-- making. Keeping them apart means the union is what the chokepoint reads, and
-- each half keeps its own reason for existing.
--
-- ## The union is resolved at request time, not materialized
--
-- A cached "effective entitlements" column was considered and rejected. A
-- downgrade that takes effect on the next cache refresh is a control with a
-- window, and the window is exactly when someone notices they can still reach
-- what they stopped paying for. The read is one round trip either way — see
-- `resolveModuleAvailability`, which folds the whole question into the
-- `awcms_tenant_modules` query the chokepoint ALREADY runs — so the cache would
-- buy staleness for nothing.
--
-- ## No `deleted_at` anywhere here
--
-- A subscription is CANCELLED (a status), and an entitlement is EXPIRED (a
-- timestamp). Both are states the row keeps carrying, because "was this customer
-- entitled last March" is the question this schema exists to answer and a
-- soft-delete flag answers it worse than a status does.
--
-- ## Bounded by design, all five
--
-- None is a log. The catalogue is bounded by what the operator authored; the
-- tenant side is bounded at one subscription per tenant (unique index) and one
-- row per (tenant, entitlement). They are registered in `BOUNDED_BY_DESIGN`
-- rather than given `dataLifecycle` descriptors, and the reason is the same one
-- `awcms_access_policies` states: an age-based purge here would delete LIVE
-- entitlements, which is not retention but an outage.
--
-- Pure DDL plus catalogue seed rows on the three GLOBAL tables — no tenant-scoped
-- row is written, so the `NO FORCE -> DML -> FORCE` toggle `sql/103` needed does
-- not apply.

-- reaches the entitlement branch, and `awcms_plan_entitlements` is empty. A

-- 7. Narrowing the three GLOBAL tables to read-only at runtime.
--
-- REQUIRED, not decorative, and the reason is that `sql/019` set
-- `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
-- DELETE ON TABLES TO awcms_app`. Every table created after it is born with all
-- four verbs, so a table DECLARED read-only in
-- `GLOBAL_TABLE_FORBIDDEN_PRIVILEGES` and never revoked here is a declaration
-- the database does not honour — the map would say "no writes" while `awcms_app`
-- held all three.
--
-- That default is right for tenant-scoped tables (`sql/019`'s own comment: a new
-- table must not silently ship unreachable at runtime) and wrong for these,
-- which is exactly why `sql/080` wrote the same three lines for the region
-- tables. The same shape, for the same reason.
--
-- Found by the DB-gated suite, not by review: every pure gate in the 40-segment
-- chain passed with the declaration and the database disagreeing, because
-- `checkRuntimeRoleGrants` is the only check that asks POSTGRES what
-- `awcms_app` actually holds.
--
-- `awcms_worker` gets nothing at all. `sql/019`'s default privileges name only
-- `awcms_app`, so the worker starts with none, and `WORKER_ROLE_GRANTS` states
-- the rule for keeping it that way: any `awcms_%` table not keyed there must be
-- ungranted for that role. No job reads a plan.
