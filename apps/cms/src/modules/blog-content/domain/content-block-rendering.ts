 * Safe, whitelist-based renderer for `content_json` (Issue #540 §Content
 * Safety Requirements: "Use structured JSON content as the source of
 * truth", "Rendering must sanitize or safely render content", "Script
 * tags/inline JavaScript/dangerous iframe-embed must be rejected or
 * stripped"). `content_json` was already write-time-rejected for unsafe
 * markup (`validateContentJsonField`, Issue #538) — this is the
 * *rendering*-side defense-in-depth layer: every block type in the
 * whitelist below only ever emits text through `escapeHtml`, and any
 * value outside the whitelist (unknown block `type`, non-string `text`,
 * raw HTML field, etc.) is silently skipped rather than rendered. There
 * is no "raw html" block type — by construction, this renderer cannot
 * emit a `<script>`/`<iframe>`/`<embed>`/`<object>` tag or an inline
 * event handler no matter what `content_json` contains.
 *
 * This is the first place in the repo that defines a concrete shape for
 * `content_json` (previously "opaque to the API", doc issue #537/#538) —
 * `{ blocks: ContentBlock[] }` with six block types: paragraph, heading,
 * list, quote, gallery (Issue #542, public image/video display, deliberately
 * not a new media-library table since there is no base media library to
 * integrate with beyond a loose URL, see
 * `sql/029_awcms_blog_content_presentation_schema.sql`'s header
 * comment), and `video_news` (Issue #639 — a safe, provider-allowlisted
 * video embed; never a raw stored `<iframe>`, see
 * `_shared/rendering/video-news-block-renderer.ts`'s header). A domain module
 * or later issue needing richer blocks (embed, table, ...) extends the
 * `switch` below, not a general raw-HTML escape hatch.
