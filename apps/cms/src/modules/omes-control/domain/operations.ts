/**
 * Safe operation allowlist (Issue ahliweb/omes#198, ADR-0122).
 *
 * The operation names below are copied verbatim from the OMES-owned contract
 * `contracts/control-center/v1/operation-request.schema.json` (ahliweb/omes
 * repository) — "the Control Center-facing shape of a safe operation
 * request ... a closed enum limited to the read/lifecycle operations issue
 * #91 exposes to tenant-scoped screens". That schema's `operation` enum is
 * `status`, `preflight`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `update`, `backup`,
 * `rollback` — deliberately a SUBSET of the broader `deployment.request`
 * enum (which also allows `install`/`configure`/`restore` for direct
 * job-runner use only).
 *
 * This module never invents an operation name, never accepts a free-form
 * command, and never widens the enum without also updating the OMES
 * contract fixture this file's own test compares against byte-for-byte.
 *
 * DESTRUCTIVE CLASSIFICATION — from `docs/jobs.md` §4 "Approval policy"
 * (ahliweb/omes): "Destructive operations — `restore`, `rollback`, `stop`,
 * `configure` — ... a job requires approval". Intersected with the
 * Control-Center-facing enum above (which has no `restore`/`configure`),
 * the destructive subset reachable through THIS API is exactly
 * `stop` and `rollback`.
