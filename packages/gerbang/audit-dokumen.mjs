/**
 * audit-dokumen.mjs — checks the markdown in this repo, not build output.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists
 *
 * Nothing else in a Bun/Astro/PostgreSQL stack ever builds markdown, so
 * nothing else ever notices when it lies. A content or type-check gate
 * reads source code and build output; the documents that describe this
 * repo's own decisions — `AGENTS.md`, an ADR, a changeset — sit entirely
 * outside that path. A dead link inside one of them sends a reader (human
 * or agent) to a decision that does not exist, and nothing goes red.
 *
 * This mechanism is adapted from `ahliweb/media-lenterakalteng`'s
 * `packages/gerbang/audit-dokumen.mjs`, which was written after that repo's
 * own ADR index was found listing six decisions that had never existed
 * there while missing nine that did — a state that survived nine further
 * ADRs with nothing catching it, for exactly the reason above. This repo
 * has no `docs/adr/` yet and so no comparable incident of its own; the
 * checks below that depend on one (§2, §3, §5) simply report themselves
 * skipped until it exists, rather than being left out and re-added later
 * under the same pressure that let the original defect stand for months.
 *
 * ## What is checked
 *
 *   1. **Dead relative links.** Every markdown link to a file in this repo
 *      must actually resolve. Resolved from the location of the file that
 *      contains it, which is what makes `.changesets/README.md`'s own rule
 *      ("links are written from `.changesets/`'s point of view") hold with
 *      no special case.
 *   2. **The ADR index is complete in both directions, with no duplicate
 *      rows** — once `docs/adr/` exists. Checked both ways because one
 *      direction alone is not enough: an ADR missing from the table and a
 *      table row pointing at a file that does not exist are two different
 *      defects, and a duplicated row can pass both checks at once (two rows
 *      for one file is still one file on each side) unless rows themselves
 *      are counted, not merely collected into a set.
 *   3. **The index's stated status agrees with the ADR file's own status.**
 *      An unrecognised status word is reported, not silently accepted.
 *   4. **File paths a document names in backticks must exist.** Not links —
 *      a code span like `` `packages/gerbang/lib/git.mjs` ``. Documents in
 *      this repo name files far more often than they link to them, and a
 *      path that used to exist, or is planned but not yet built, reads
 *      exactly like one that does unless something checks. Paths that
 *      genuinely belong to another repo, or describe a workspace this repo
 *      has not built yet, are listed in `EXCLUDED_PATHS` below together
 *      with who they belong to and (where the reason is specific to one
 *      document rather than the whole corpus) which document may cite them.
 *   5. **`ADR-NNNN` citations resolve to their file** — once `docs/adr/`
 *      exists. A citation of another repo's ADR is written with a marker
 *      (`awcms`, "reference repo", or a github link) in the same paragraph
 *      and is skipped; one with neither a local file nor a marker is a
 *      citation to nowhere, the same defect class as a dead link in a form
 *      that never became a link.
 *   6. **Numbers stated in prose agree with the set they claim to count.**
 *      Not every spelled-out number — most do not count anything that
 *      grows. Only a block the author marks explicitly:
 *      `<!-- hitung:mulai key=<slug> source=<spec> --> … <!-- hitung:selesai -->`,
 *      with `source` either `table-rows` (markdown table body rows inside
 *      the block) or `match:<path>:<regex>` (the count of unique capture-1
 *      values of that regex over another file in this repo). Every spelled
 *      number inside a marked block must agree with that count, and a
 *      marked block containing no spelled number at all is reported, not
 *      passed — a marker that guards nothing will rot exactly like the
 *      unmarked prose it was meant to replace.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT checked
 *
 *   - **External URLs.** Checking them needs a network, and a gate that
 *     fails because a third-party site is down is a gate people learn to
 *     ignore.
 *   - **Anchors (`#section`).** Heading slugification differs across
 *     renderers, so checking it means guessing GitHub's own rule. The file
 *     part of an anchored link is still checked; the anchor is discarded.
 *   - **Spelled numbers with no `hitung:` marker.** Deliberate, for the same
 *     reason the marker exists at all: a gate that reddens on every spelled
 *     number is a gate people learn to work around, which is worse than no
 *     gate.
 *   - **`apps/cms/**`.** `ahliweb/awcms`'s own markdown corpus, imported
 *     whole via `git subtree` — its relative links, its own ADR
 *     conventions (a different numbering scheme from this repo's), and its
 *     own `ADR-NNNN` citations are all written for its own tree, not for
 *     sitting under `apps/cms/`. Checking it here would report hundreds of
 *     "violations" that are correct in the tree they were written for. It
 *     has its own gates (`bun run check:cms`).
 *
 * Run: `bun run audit:dokumen`. Needs no build, no network, no `apps/cms`.
 *
 * The first optional argument is the root to check (default `.`), which is
 * what lets `tests/audit-dokumen.test.mjs` run this over a fixture tree and
 * prove each check actually goes red when its defect is reproduced.
