/**
 * `POST /api/v1/media/objects/{id}/purge` (ADR-0056 §B) — hard-delete the
 * registry row of an already soft-deleted media object.
 *
 * ## `purge` clears the REGISTRY, not the R2 bytes
 *
 * This is the decision ADR-0056 §B states explicitly, and it is not an
 * oversight to be fixed later. The reconciliation job
 * (`scripts/news-media-r2-reconcile.ts`) owns the bucket and has the ordering
 * discipline for deleting from it. A second writer here would mean two
 * processes with two different ideas of what is safe to remove from one bucket.
 *
 * Accepted and stated cost: a window where the R2 object outlives its registry
 * row. The next reconciliation tick sees a key with no row, categorises it as
 * orphan-in-R2, and removes it — the job's existing self-healing path, not a
 * new one.
 *
 * ## Eligibility, and the 409 a foreign key produces
 *
 * The row must already be soft-deleted; `purgeNewsMediaObject` enforces that in
 * its `WHERE`, so purging a live object answers 404 rather than destroying it.
 * `awcms_news_portal_ad_placements.media_object_id` is a hard NOT NULL FK with
 * no `ON DELETE`, so purging a still-referenced object answers `409
 * MEDIA_OBJECT_REFERENCED`. That path runs inside a savepoint — see the
 * application function — because in PostgreSQL a `23503` aborts the whole
 * transaction, and the COMMIT `withTenant` performs on a returned 4xx would
 * fail with it.
 *
 * `purge` is in `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS` and is the one action here that cannot be
 * undone, so `Idempotency-Key` is required.
