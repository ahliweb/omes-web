/**
 * Idempotent rebuild engine (Issue #753 — "idempotent rebuild is a
 * concurrency/correctness hazard, not just a nice-to-have").
 *
 * SAFETY MODEL (read before touching this file):
 * 1. `triggerOrResumeRebuild` is the ONLY place a rebuild's cursors/metrics
 *    are ever reset to zero. It runs the "does a running rebuild already
 *    exist? -> if not, INSERT the new run row AND reset every rebuildSource
 *    stream's cursor/metric rows" sequence entirely within the CALLER's own
 *    already-open transaction (`tx`, always the API route's `withTenant`
 *    callback in practice — see `src/pages/api/v1/reports/projections/
 *    [key]/rebuild/index.ts`), so a crash between "insert the run row" and
 *    "reset cursors/metrics" is IMPOSSIBLE — either the whole reset commits
 *    together with the new run row AND the caller's own audit-log write and
 *    idempotency-record save, or (on any failure) NONE of it does and the
 *    OLD projection state (from before this rebuild was even requested) is
 *    untouched. Migration 069's partial unique index
 *    (`awcms_reporting_rebuild_runs_running_unique`, `WHERE status =
 *    'running'`) additionally makes "two concurrent triggers both try to
 *    reset at once" impossible at the database level: `createRebuildRun`'s
 *    `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING` inserts zero rows for the
 *    loser (a normal, non-poisoning outcome, not a thrown exception), which
 *    this function detects and re-reads `findRunningRebuild` to return the
 *    WINNER's run instead (never a silent double-reset).
 * 2. `continueRebuildPasses` NEVER resets anything — it only ever advances
 *    an ALREADY-RUNNING run's cursors forward via the exact same bounded,
 *    single-transaction "select batch -> apply deltas -> advance cursor"
 *    shape `projection-incremental-worker.ts`'s `runCursorStreamPass` uses
 *    for steady-state updates (this file's own `runRebuildStreamPass` is a
 *    near-identical sibling, differing only in ALSO checking
 *    `cancel_requested` and incrementing `rows_processed` in the same
 *    transaction). Because each pass's cursor only advances after that
 *    SAME transaction commits, a crash/kill between two passes leaves the
 *    cursor and the metric counters it produced in matching, consistent
 *    state at exactly the last COMPLETED pass — resuming (calling
 *    `continueRebuildPasses` again, whether from a retried API call, the
 *    next scheduled worker tick, or an operator re-triggering rebuild
 *    while one is already `'running'`, which `triggerOrResumeRebuild`
 *    turns into "return the existing running run" rather than a reset)
 *    picks up EXACTLY where the last committed pass left off — never
 *    re-counting an already-counted row (the cursor already moved past
 *    it) and never skipping a row (the cursor never advances past a row
 *    it has not yet counted).
 * 3. While a run is `'running'` for a (tenant, projection), the STEADY-
 *    STATE incremental path (both the `cursor_table` worker and the
 *    `domain_event` live consumer) skips that (tenant, projection)
 *    entirely (see `projection-incremental-worker.ts`'s
 *    `runCursorStreamPass` guard and `event-activity-projection.ts`'s own
 *    check) — this is what prevents the rebuild's full re-scan and a
 *    concurrent live update from BOTH counting the same newly-arrived
 *    row.
 * 4. Issue #151 — points 1-3 above are all "check, then act" sequences,
 *    and at READ COMMITTED a check and an act are NOT atomic with respect
 *    to a concurrently committing writer even inside one transaction
 *    (every statement re-snapshots). Every writer of a (tenant,
 *    projection)'s cursor/metric rows — `triggerOrResumeRebuild` and
 *    `runRebuildStreamPass` here, `runCursorStreamPass` in the incremental
 *    worker, `applyEventActivityProjectionIncrement` in the event consumer
 *    — therefore takes that pair's `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
 *    (`projection-lock.ts`) as the FIRST statement of its transaction.
 *    That is what actually makes points 1-3 hold; without it, the reset in
 *    point 1 could land in the middle of an already-in-flight incremental
 *    pass and both paths would apply the same delta. See
 *    `projection-lock.ts`'s header for the full argument.
