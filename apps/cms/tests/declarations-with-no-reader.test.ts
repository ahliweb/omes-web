/**
 * Three declarations nothing read — findings D7, D8 and D15 of the 17 August
 * 2026 audit round.
 *
 * They are one file because they are one habit, and this repository already
 * keeps a memory of it: a field is declared, it passes every shape check, and
 * no runtime code ever reads it. The shape check is what makes it durable — a
 * registry gate that verifies STRUCTURE reports "present" for a value that
 * decides nothing, and the next reader takes the declaration as evidence of
 * behaviour.
 *
 * Each of the three resolved differently, and the difference is the point:
 *
 * - **D7** — the unread setting was DELETED, because the only way to make it
 *   read would weaken a control. Asserted as an absence, plus the behaviour
 *   that must not change.
 * - **D8** — the unscreened permission was moved from a register of DECISIONS
 *   to the shrink-only ledger of work not done. Asserted as membership, in
 *   both directions.
 * - **D15** — the port stays unwired, and the two comments that explained the
 *   wiring with a false fact are corrected. Asserted as source, because the
 *   defect WAS the prose.
