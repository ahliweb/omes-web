/**
 * The one place a role grant is written (ADR-0078, Gelombang 3 PR 3.2 of #423).
 *
 * Every path that used to `INSERT INTO awcms_access_assignments` calls
 * `grantRolePolicy`, and every path that removed a grant calls
 * `revokeRoleGrants`.
 *
 * ## NOT a dual write
 *
 * ADR-0078 chose a third table precisely so expand/migrate/contract needs no
 * dual write. A grant lands in ONE table: `awcms_access_policies`. Writing both
 * would reintroduce the failure this design avoids — two writes that can succeed
 * apart, leaving a subject holding a role according to one table and not the
 * other, with no way to tell which is right.
 *
 * ## Why removal stopped looking in two places (ADR-0079)
 *
 * Until `sql/103` it had to: a grant could live in either table, and a remover
 * that knew only about the new one would report success while the role survived.
 * The backfill ended that — every legacy row is now ALSO a policy row (same
 * `id`), `awcms_access_assignments` is read-only history that no reader consults,
 * and `awcms_app` no longer holds `DELETE` on it. Keeping the legacy `DELETE`
 * here would now fail the whole revocation with `42501` on a statement that can
 * only ever match rows nothing reads.
