/**
 * `materializeMembership()` — turning an accepted offer into an account
 * (ADR-0082, Gelombang 4 PR 4.2 of #423).
 *
 * ## Why this is ONE function
 *
 * There are already three places in this repository that bring a membership
 * into existence: `approveRegistrationRequest`, `jitProvisionIdentity`, and
 * `bootstrapPlatformTenant`. They agree on the shape — profile, then identity,
 * then tenant user — and they have already drifted once on the detail that
 * matters most (`verification_status`), which is what produced
 * `createPersonProfileForIdentity` as a single writer.
 *
 * This is the fourth, and it is deliberately written as one function with one
 * caller rather than as a helper the others are re-pointed at. Gelombang 7
 * replaces the identity row with a global principal, and it needs exactly one
 * place to redirect. Re-pointing the existing three now would make this PR a
 * refactor of self-registration and SSO on top of everything else — and would
 * turn `tests/access-assignment-writers.test.ts` red for a reason unrelated to
 * invitations, since its non-vacuity assertion names `self-registration.ts` by
 * path as a direct caller of `grantRolePolicy`.
 *
 * ## The system-role refusal happens HERE too
 *
 * `createInvitation` already refused a role marked `is_system`. This checks
 * again, because the two moments can be days apart: a role can be marked
 * system, soft-deleted, or dropped from the catalogue in between, and the
 * invitation would still be carrying its id. `approveRegistrationRequest` sets
 * the precedent — and the program doc requires the check at both ends.
 *
 * ## Every refusal precedes every write
 *
 * A 4xx returned from inside `withTenant` COMMITs. Each refusal below is
 * resolved before the first INSERT, so a rejected acceptance leaves nothing
 * behind but its audit row.
