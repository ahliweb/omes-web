/**
 * `bun run design:token-contrast:check` — ADR-0120.
 *
 * Reads the colour tokens out of `src/styles/tokens.css` and asserts that every
 * foreground/background pair the design system actually PUTS ON SCREEN clears
 * WCAG 2.1 AA, in BOTH themes.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists
 *
 * `docs/awcms/14_ui_ux_design_system.md` §Aksesibilitas promises AA. Until now
 * nothing checked it, and the promise was kept by whoever remembered to measure.
 * Twice it was not:
 *
 *   1. Issue #434 found `--color-primary` + white text at 3.68:1 in the dark
 *      theme. The fix was the `-strong` token family, and the docblock in
 *      `tokens.css` explaining it is excellent — and it is prose. It could not
 *      stop the next one.
 *   2. PR #720 found the SAME defect again in `StatusBadge`'s `info` variant,
 *      3.68:1 light / 2.43:1 dark, sitting in a file whose own comment already
 *      described the rule it was breaking.
 *
 * The redesign then found it a third and fourth time, in the opposite direction
 * — dark text on a pale tint. Three of the five obvious `--color-X` on
 * `--color-X-soft` pairs measured 4.07–4.48:1, and `--color-text-faint` passed
 * on `--color-surface` while failing at 4.39:1 on `--color-surface-3`, which is
 * the `<thead>` background where that token is used most.
 *
 * Four occurrences of one defect class is the point at which a comment is the
 * wrong instrument. This is the right one.
 *
 * ## What it checks, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It checks PAIRS THAT ARE DECLARED BELOW — a registry, not a sweep. A sweep
 * over every token combination would report hundreds of pairs nobody renders
 * and train its readers to ignore it (the same reasoning
 * `i18n:screens:check` gives for not scanning attributes).
 *
 * The cost of a registry is stated rather than hidden: a NEW pairing introduced
 * in CSS without a line here is not measured. Two things push against that —
 * every entry names the rule that renders it, so an unregistered pairing is
 * visible in review as a rule with no entry; and the registry fails when a
 * token it names disappears, so it cannot quietly stop measuring after a rename.
 *
 * It does NOT check contrast against `--color-bg`, only against the surfaces
 * text actually sits on. Nothing in this admin puts text directly on the page
 * background — every screen's text is inside a card, a table or the shell.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic on one file. No database, no network, no build output.
