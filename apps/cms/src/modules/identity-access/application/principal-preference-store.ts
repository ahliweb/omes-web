/**
 * The ONLY module that reads or writes `awcms_principal_preferences`
 * (ADR-0095, sql/128).
 *
 * ## Why a single store module, when this table holds nothing secret
 *
 * `awcms_principal_preferences` is GLOBAL and has no RLS, exactly like
 * `awcms_principals` and `awcms_principal_mfa_factors`. For those two,
 * `bun run identity:principal-access:check` enforces a per-file allow-list
 * because the rows are a credential and a targeting list. This table is neither
 * — it holds the string `"id"` — so widening that gate to cover it would blur
 * what the gate is actually protecting (ADR-0095 §"Keputusan 1" states this
 * explicitly).
 *
 * The confinement is kept anyway, as a convention rather than a gate, for the
 * reason that outlives the security argument: a table with no RLS has no
 * database-side answer to "which rows may this caller see", so the ONLY place
 * that answer can be written down is the query. Every query below is keyed by
 * `principal_id` and returns at most one row. Nothing here scans, and nothing
 * here takes a `LIKE`.
 *
 * ## Reads never throw
 *
 * A display preference is chrome. `readPreferences` degrades to "no opinion" on
 * any fault, so a hiccup reading this table renders the admin in the fallback
 * language instead of 500-ing the page. Writes are the opposite: an account
 * screen that reports success without persisting is worse than an error.
