/**
 * Theme asset slots resolve through `MediaLibraryPort`, and unresolvable slots
 * degrade instead of failing.
 *
 * ## What this covers that nothing did
 *
 * `resolveThemeAssetUrls` returned `{}` unconditionally and had no test — there
 * was nothing to assert. The empty return was written when `media_library` did
 * not exist, and survived the module landing because the file's own header
 * explained the no-op as intentional. Nothing compared that explanation to the
 * registry, so a tenant's uploaded logo silently never rendered.
 *
 * The omission path is the one that actually matters in production. A theme is
 * public-facing: a stale, deleted, or cross-tenant asset id must drop the slot
 * and fall back, never throw, or a bad id takes down the page. The port already
 * guarantees "unsafe ids are absent from the map, never thrown"; these tests
 * pin that this function relies on exactly that and adds no second, driftable
 * validation of its own.
 *
 * A fake port, not a database: the behaviour under test is the mapping from
 * `assetRefs` to slot-keyed URLs and what happens when a lookup misses. Both
 * are pure given the port's contract, and the real port has its own DB-backed
 * tests.
