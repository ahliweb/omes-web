/**
 * The versioned catalog of event types this runtime is aware of ("runtime
 * registry and AsyncAPI event types/versions pass bidirectional parity
 * checks"). `appendDomainEvent` (`application/append-domain-event.ts`)
 * REFUSES to persist an event whose `(eventType, eventVersion)` is not
 * listed here — this is the mechanism (not just documentation) that stops
 * "event types/versions silently drifting" from the published AsyncAPI
 * contract: a new/changed event type must be added HERE first (reviewed
 * source code), which `tests/domain-event-registry-parity.test.ts` then
 * cross-checks against `asyncapi/awcms-domain-events.asyncapi.yaml` in both
 * directions (registry entry without a channel = fail; a channel this
 * runtime's own consumer registry subscribes to without a matching entry
 * here = fail).
 *
 * Scope note: this module ships exactly one registered event type — a
 * self-contained reference/example (`sample.recorded`) used to exercise and
 * prove the outbox/dispatcher/ordering/retry/DLQ/replay mechanism
 * end-to-end. Future producer modules add their OWN entries here (and their
 * own `module.ts` `events.publishes` entries, and their own AsyncAPI
 * channels) when they start calling `appendDomainEvent`.
