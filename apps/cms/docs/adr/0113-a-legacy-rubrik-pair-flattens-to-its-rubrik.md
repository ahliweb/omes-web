# ADR-0113 — A legacy rubrik pair flattens to its rubrik, and a legacy search URL keeps its query

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-25
- **Decision maker:** ahliweb
- **Amended:** 26 August 2026 — the normalisation section was factually wrong (`seo_title()` is never called); the decision is unchanged. See below.
- **Amended again:** 26 August 2026 — **the shape-4 decision is RETRACTED** (that URL family has never existed, see below), and the claim that `awcms-astro` needs no change is **false** and is replaced by [ADR-0114](0114-the-edge-owns-the-legacy-301s-and-an-article-is-found-by-its-id.md). The flattening decision for shapes 2 and 3 is unchanged.
- **Amended by:** [ADR-0114](0114-the-edge-owns-the-legacy-301s-and-an-article-is-found-by-its-id.md) — the 301s are executed at the **edge**, not in either application, and a legacy article URL is keyed on its leading digits rather than on an exact path. The destinations this ADR chose are unchanged; their carrier is not.
- **Related:** Issue #711 (the half of the SeputarBorneo cutover this unblocks); Issue #599 (the ARTICLE half — this ADR originally called it "already cutover-ready" and that was **false**: the shipped article template matches **0 of 25,029** URLs and an unmatched `/news/**` 301s into a 404, see [ADR-0114](0114-the-edge-owns-the-legacy-301s-and-an-article-is-found-by-its-id.md)); ADR-0045 / ADR-0070 (the public URL vocabulary is split, and the news archive is rendered by `ahliweb/awcms-astro`); ADR-0039 (redirect governance); ADR-0111 (a rule that cannot fire is worse than no rule); `sql/060` §2 (exact-path rules only, by design); PRD §9.2 (no chain longer than one hop)

## Context

The legacy `.htaccess` at `/home/data/dev_php/seputarborneo.com/.htaccess` has **five** rewrite rules, not the two every version of the plan named — and, as the second amendment below establishes, only **four** of them can ever fire:

```
^news/([^/]*)\.html$          -> /berita/?news=$1          # article  — #599
^rubrik/([^/]*)\.html$        -> /rubriks/?news=$1         # rubrik   — HERE
^([^/]*)/([^/]*)\.html$       -> /rubriks/?news=$1&kt=$2   # catch-all — HERE
^cari_berita/([^/]*)\.html$   -> /pencarian/…              # DEAD — never reached
^([^/]*)\.html$               -> /data/?halaman=$1         # page     — #599
```

**Read the order of that table, not just its rows.** The catch-all is `.htaccess`
line 6 and `cari_berita` is line 7, so shape 4 sits **below** a rule that already
claims every path it could ever match. This ADR originally printed the table in
this order and decided shape 4 anyway; see the retraction below.

Shapes 2 and 3 were blocked, and the issue named two blockers. **The first does not exist.** The rubrik list was believed missing because the working copy's dump `seputa58_sbb.sql` is 0 bytes. It is — and it is not where the data lives: `docker-compose.yml` mounts that file only as an initdb seed while the datadir is the named volume `seputarborneocom_db_data`, which holds 411 MB. An initdb script runs only against an empty datadir, so the empty file has been inert since the volume was first populated.

There is also no rubrik _table_, because there was never meant to be one. `include/rubrik.php` answers with `SELECT … FROM berita_red_tayang WHERE jenis_rubrik = ? AND kategori = ?` — `jenis_rubrik` and `kategori` are **columns on `berita_red`**. Measured against a throwaway copy of the volume: **25,029 articles, 47 distinct `jenis_rubrik`, 46 distinct `kategori`, 102 distinct pairs.**

**The second blocker is the real one, and it is this ADR.** Where those URLs should land is a question about a vocabulary this repo does not own: ADR-0045/ADR-0070 put the news archive in `ahliweb/awcms-astro`. That repo's routes are `/kategori/[slug]` (with `/halaman/[nomor]`), `/tag/[slug]`, `/[tab]` and `/[tab]/[...slug]`, and `/cari` — **one** level of category, where the legacy archive has two.

## Decision

**1. Shapes 2 and 3 both 301 to `/kategori/{jenis_rubrik}`. The `kt` segment is dropped.** (As originally written this said `seo_title(jenis_rubrik)`; see the first amendment — the segment is the raw column value, and the map is keyed accordingly.)

**~~2. Shape 4 301s to `/cari?q={percent-encoded query}`.~~ RETRACTED — see §Shape 4 has never existed.** The rule it decides has never fired on the legacy site, so there is no such URL family to redirect.

### Why flattening, and not the three alternatives

- It targets a route `awcms-astro` **already has**, so the cutover needs no new route there, no new list-API surface here, and no fourth cross-repo contract step.
- It is one hop, which PRD §9.2 requires.
- A reader lands on a list that is **broader** than the one they asked for, never a wrong one. That is the property the alternatives lose.

**Category + tag** (`jenis_rubrik` → category, `kategori` → tag) also needs no new routes, and both exist in `awcms-astro`. It was rejected because it drops the AND: `/hukum/pidana.html` would land on every article tagged `pidana` across every rubrik, which is a genuinely wrong page rather than a wide one.

**A composite slug per pair** (`/kategori/hukum-pidana`) keeps the exact granularity and is still one hop. It was rejected because it invents a 102-entry vocabulary no editor ever chose, and a category list that size stops being navigation.

**A nested `/kategori/[slug]/[sub]` route** in `awcms-astro` is the only option that preserves the pair exactly. It was rejected as the most expensive thing on the list — a new route, a two-level taxonomy or composite filter on this repo's list API, and a fresh ADR-0045/0070 contract — bought for a refinement the archive has not been shown to need.

### AMENDED 26 August 2026 — the normalisation section below was WRONG

The decision above is unchanged. Its stated mechanics were not, and the
correction matters because it changes what gets built.

**This ADR said the map keys on `seo_title(jenis_rubrik)`. `seo_title()` is dead
code.** It is _defined_ nine times across the legacy PHP tree and **called zero
times** — and the nine copies do not even agree: `index.php` replaces spaces
with `_` while the other eight use `-`. `rubriks/index.php` binds the URL
segments **raw**, after a `trim()`, straight into
`WHERE jenis_rubrik = ? AND kategori = ?`. A legacy rubrik URL segment is the
column value, not a slug of it.

**So the `MITRA BORNEO` / `MITRA-BORNEO` warning was wrong too.** Without
slugification they are `/rubrik/MITRA%20BORNEO.html` and
`/rubrik/MITRA-BORNEO.html` — different paths that never collapse. Neither is
linked from anywhere on the site, so neither needs a rule at all.

**How the error happened, because it is the reusable part.** The claim entered
as prose in an issue comment, was carried into this ADR, and was never checked
against a call site — the same shape as the `replaceMenuItems` function that
did not exist (NAME ROUND) and the `awcms_blog_pages.legacy_source_*` columns
that had no reader. A function that is quoted but never called reads exactly
like a function that runs. **Grep for the CALL, not the definition.**

### What the URLs actually are

Nothing in the legacy tree generates a rubrik link from a column value. Every
one is a hand-typed literal, which is what makes them **enumerable and
complete** rather than a sample — a crawler could only ever reach what was
linked. There are **68**, and they are committed with their provenance at
`data/seputarborneo-legacy/rubrik-redirects.json` — count that file, it is the
authority. (This ADR was written against **67**; a later sweep of the legacy
tree found `Mitra-Borneo/Pemkab Lamandau`, linked by the nav **without** the
`.html` the original extraction keyed on, and it is the 68th. The counts in this
section are back-annotated to the committed map; no `targetPath` was rewritten
and the destination set is still ten.)

Two properties of that set decide the work:

- **Casing is load-bearing here and was not on the legacy site.** MariaDB's
  `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` made `rubrik/Hukum.html` and `rubrik/hukum.html` the same
  page (5,183 articles each). `awcms_seo_redirects` matches
  `normalized_source_path` by **equality** and `normalizeRedirectPath` preserves
  case, so **both spellings need their own rule**. Five rubriks were linked in
  both casings.
- **33 of the 68 resolved to ZERO articles** — dead nav and footer links, for
  years, serving HTTP 200 with an empty listing rather than a 404, so search
  engines will have indexed them as thin pages. Eight are leftovers from the
  template this site was built from and name places in **South Sumatra**
  (`daerah/Kikim%20Area.html`, `daerah/Lahat%20Kota.html`, …).
  `rubrik/Olah Raga.html` is dead for an instructive reason: the column value is
  `OLAHRAGA`, with no space, and a case-insensitive collation does not close a
  whitespace difference.

**A dead URL 301s to its first segment's archive when that segment resolves** —
28 of the 33, an improvement on an empty 200 for a reader and a consolidation
for a crawler. The remaining **5 orphans** (`rubrik/kuliner`,
`rubrik/Olah Raga`, `rubrik/pariwisata`, `rubrik/travel`, `rubrik/Viral`) have
nothing to point at and get **no rule**; 410 is not expressible, since
`RedirectStatusCode` is 301/302/307/308 only, so the alternative to a rule is a 404.

That leaves **63 rules over 10 destination categories** — and because the
decision drops `kt`, every URL of either shape lands on its parent rubrik's
archive, so the whole map is a function of the first segment alone.

### RETRACTED 26 August 2026 — shape 4 has NEVER existed

The section this replaces decided what `/cari_berita/{q}.html` should 301 to, and
argued about which subset of an unbounded family deserved a rule. **No such URL
has ever been served by that rule.** The whole question was empty.

**The mechanism is rule ORDER.** In `.htaccess` the two-segment catch-all
`^([^/]*)/([^/]*)\.html$` is line **6** and `^cari_berita/([^/]*)\.html$` is line
**7** — and shape 4's language is a strict **subset** of the catch-all's. Both
docker vhosts carry the same pair in the same order (lines 33/34), and rule 3 has
preceded rule 4 in every commit that has ever touched the file. `mod_rewrite`
evaluates rules top to bottom, so line 7 is dead: by the time it is considered,
the URL has already been rewritten to `/rubriks/?news=cari_berita&kt=q` and no
longer begins with `cari_berita/`.

**This is order, not the `[L]` flag.** Removing `[L]` would not revive it. `[L]`
stops the current pass; what kills line 7 is that the string it is matched
against is no longer the legacy URL.

Verified three ways rather than argued:

- **Brute force.** Over 3,375 candidate paths, **0** matched shape 4 without also
  matching the catch-all. The same harness, run against an artificially widened
  shape 4, correctly produced a counterexample — so the null result is the
  scanner working, not the scanner blind.
- **Live.** `/cari_berita/sampit.html` and `/rubriks/?news=cari_berita&kt=sampit`
  differ on exactly one line of output (`og:url`). The first is being served as a
  **shape-3** URL.
- **Corpus.** **Zero** of the **5,170** archived URLs are `/cari_berita/*.html`,
  and no template in the legacy tree emits such a link. (This bullet first said
  5,174, measured before the pull was committed. The corpus is now committed
  verbatim as `data/seputarborneo-legacy/wayback-cdx-2026-08-26.txt` and is
  5,170 lines — count it. The **conclusion is unchanged**: zero
  `/cari_berita/*.html`, so the retraction below stands on the same evidence.)

**Two things this dissolves.** #711's open item _"`cari_berita` rules — needs the
live sitemap"_ is dissolved twice over: the rule never fired, and there is no
legacy sitemap and never was one, in the tree or in git history. And the argument
above about admitting a pattern engine for an unbounded family was answering a
question that had no subject.

**The residual is real and must be stated.** `/cari_berita/X.html` still returns
200 today — as a **shape-3** URL, already decided by this ADR's rule 1. It must
**never** be turned into a `/cari?q=` redirect, which would send readers somewhere
the legacy site never sent them.

`awcms_seo_redirects` remains exact-path only **by design** — `sql/060` says so in
its own header: _"there is NO pattern/regex/rewrite column anywhere in this table.
Prefix/pattern rules are deferred to a future ADR precisely because they would
introduce a pattern engine (ReDoS)."_ That is unchanged and this ADR still does
not admit one; there is simply no longer a candidate family that would want one.

### One mechanical constraint, verified against the code rather than assumed

- **A trailing slash is not stored.** `/kategori/hukum/` normalises to `/kategori/hukum`. Recorded so the stored value is not later read as a different rule from the one that was written.

The second constraint recorded here — that a query must be percent-encoded before
`validateRedirectTarget` will accept it — was true about the code and is now
without a caller, because it existed only to serve the retracted shape-4 rule.
`normalizeRedirectPath` still refuses whitespace as a CRLF/header-injection
defence; nothing in this cutover writes a target with a query any more.

## Consequences

**Term provenance is not needed, and that answers #711's third Definition-of-Done item by dissolving it rather than by building it.** That item offered a choice between adding `legacy_source_id` to `awcms_blog_terms` and hand-writing a `--term-map`. Under this decision, shapes 2 and 3 become exact-path → exact-path rules that resolve without ever looking up a term row, so neither is required. This matters beyond convenience: `sql/147` has just deleted the `awcms_blog_pages.legacy_source_*` pair that was added on the same reasoning and never wired to a reader. Adding a second dead provenance column to answer a requirement that no longer exists would have repeated that exactly.

**The TEN target categories must exist in the tenant before cutover.** If they do not, every rule 301s into a 404 — ADR-0111's failure one step over, and the outcome #711's own Definition of Done forbids. The map is derivable, but it is not safe to load until the destinations are real.

This paragraph originally said "47-or-fewer", and that number was never the go-live checklist. **47 was an upper bound on `jenis_rubrik`, not a count of destinations**, and it was itself a MariaDB `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` figure: a case-insensitive `DISTINCT` reports 47/46, while a JS map keyed by exact name over the same rows sees **48/45**. The built map has **10** distinct destinations, named in `data/seputarborneo-legacy/README.md`: `bisnis`, `budaya`, `daerah`, `hukum`, `mitra-borneo`, `nasional`, `olahraga`, `politik`, `provinsi`, `wisata`.

**~~`awcms-astro` needs no change for this.~~ FALSE — see [ADR-0114](0114-the-edge-owns-the-legacy-301s-and-an-article-is-found-by-its-id.md).** This paragraph asserted that "the redirect is resolved in this repo before its routes are reached". It is not, and it cannot be: `/kategori/**` is served by `ahliweb/awcms-astro`, so a request for it never reaches this repo's middleware — the only place `awcms_seo_redirects` is ever applied. All 67 entries committed at that moment were replayed against that repo's real built server and returned 404 with zero `Location` headers (the map is 68 now; the 68th was added afterwards and has not been replayed — see ADR-0114). ADR-0114 moves the 301s to the edge and keeps every destination this ADR chose.

**What remains on #711 is not a table load.** The map is built and committed (`data/seputarborneo-legacy/`), and every source path and target in it is checked against `normalizeRedirectPath` / `validateRedirectTarget` / `isValidSlug` on every test run — which remains a useful shape check even though, under ADR-0114, those are no longer the functions that will execute the redirect. What is left is creating the ten destination categories, generating the edge artefact, and wiring it in. There are no `cari_berita` rules to write, and no legacy sitemap to write them from.
