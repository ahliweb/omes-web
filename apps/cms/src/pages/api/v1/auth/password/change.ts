/**
 * `POST /api/v1/auth/password/change` (Gelombang 2 PR 2.4 of #423) — change my
 * own password while signed in.
 *
 * The counterpart to `reset.ts`: that endpoint serves someone who CANNOT sign in
 * and proves control of a mailbox; this one serves someone who is signed in and
 * proves control of the credential. Self-service and unpermissioned for the same
 * reason as the session endpoints — the subject is the bearer, and there is no
 * parameter with which to name anybody else.
 *
 * ## Second factor only from people who have one
 *
 * `password-change.ts` records the argument in full. In short: requiring `aal2`
 * unconditionally would permanently prevent every user without MFA from changing
 * their password, and the ones most likely to need to are the ones who just
 * learned it leaked.
 *
 * ## Rate limited despite being authenticated
 *
 * `currentPassword` is a guessable secret, so this is a credential-guessing
 * surface even behind a session — the case that matters is a borrowed or stolen
 * session being used to hunt for the password it did not come with. Keyed on the
 * SOURCE, not the account: an identifier-keyed bucket here would let anyone who
 * can reach the endpoint hold one person's own password change hostage.
 *
 * ## Audited, with no password-shaped attribute anywhere
 *
 * A credential change is a security event, so it is recorded like one — with the
 * device shape and IP pseudonym that make an investigation possible, and with
 * neither password, not even a length.
