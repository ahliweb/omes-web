  // Issue ahliweb/omes#200 landed the first five entries (overview, servers,
  // deployments, operations, jobs). Issue ahliweb/omes#201 (parent #195)
  // added health, backups, audit in the SAME change as the three pages under
  // `src/pages/admin/omes/*` they name, per
  // `tests/admin-navigation-registry.test.ts`'s two-directional check.
  // Issue ahliweb/omes#233 adds the ninth and final entry, `enrollments`.
  //
  // Every `requiredPermission` below is one of the 13 `omes_control`
  // permissions `sql/155_awcms_omes_control_permissions.sql` already seeds —
  // no new permission migration for this issue either. Health reuses
  // `servers.read` (its own endpoint, `GET /api/v1/omes/health`, is guarded
  // by exactly that permission — see that route's own comment for why there
  // is no separate `health.read`).
  //
  // `enrollments.manage` was DELIBERATELY left without a navigation entry by
  // #201 — servers.astro (#200) already rendered each server's
  // enrollment/trust EVIDENCE (read-only), and issuing/revoking enrollment
  // tokens was a distinct write-capability reachable only via
  // `POST /api/v1/omes/servers/{id}/enrollment-challenges` and its
  // `/revoke` sibling (both `ahliweb/omes#198`). Issue ahliweb/omes#233
  // closes that gap with `enrollments.astro`, which calls those SAME two
  // endpoints — unmodified by this issue — and adds no new write path.
  //
  // None of these nine screens' actions cross a tenant boundary — every
  // `omes_control` table carries `tenant_id` with FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
  // (sql/154) and every application-layer query in this module scopes on the
  // caller's own `tenantId` (`server-directory.ts`, `deployment-directory.ts`,
  // `job-directory.ts`, `operation-directory.ts`, `health-directory.ts`,
  // `backup-directory.ts`, `audit-directory.ts`, `backup-restore.ts`,
  // `enrollment-directory.ts`, `enrollment-management.ts`). Per ADR-0051
  // §Keputusan butir 1–3, a platform-scoped gate is required only for an
  // action whose EFFECT reaches another tenant's data — this extends to
  // `backups.restore`/`backups.rollback`
  // (`application/backup-restore.ts`'s `submitBackupRestore` resolves the
  // target `serverId` from a `SELECT ... WHERE tenant_id = ${tenantId} AND
  // id = ${backupId}` lookup, so a foreign `backupId` resolves to
  // `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` rather than a foreign server) and to
  // `enrollments.manage` (`issueEnrollmentChallengeForServer`/
  // `revokeEnrollment` resolve their target server the same way, by
  // `tenant_id = ${tenantId} AND id = ${serverRowId}`, so a foreign
  // `serverRowId` resolves to `server_not_found`/`not_found`, never a
  // foreign server) — none of these reach another tenant's data, so the
  // ordinary tenant-seeded `omes_control` permissions remain sufficient and
  // no platform-only permission is added.
