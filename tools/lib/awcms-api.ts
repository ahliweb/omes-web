/**
 * tools/lib/awcms-api.ts — issue #58.
 *
 * The minimal HTTP client `tools/import-seputarborneo.ts` needs for exactly
 * TWO things: the `--assign-institutions` follow-up pass, run AFTER
 * `bun run blog:legacy:import` has committed the archive, and the
 * `--push-redirects` loop (`tools/lib/redirect-push.ts`, review round 2 of
 * PR #67) that posts `redirects.json` to `POST /api/v1/seo/redirects/import`
 * in 200-item, idempotency-keyed chunks. Copied out of
 * `tools/seed-borneojek-mart.ts`'s own `apiCall`/`Session`/`assertOk` (that
 * file exports nothing — checked directly, `grep -n "^export "
 * tools/seed-borneojek-mart.ts` matches zero lines — so this is a copy, not
 * an import, matching the same convention `tools/lib/mysql-dump-reader.ts`'s
 * header set).
 *
 * ## Why this file still exists after the exporter rework
 *
 * `bun run blog:legacy:import` (the upstream operator pipeline this issue's
 * PR now targets, per its own docblock) writes `termIds` via `--term-map`,
 * but calls `syncPostTermAssignments` ONLY — nowhere in that script, or in
 * `legacy-import-directory.ts`'s `importLegacyBlogPost`, is there a call to
 * `syncPostInstitutionAssignments`. Checked directly, not assumed: neither
 * file mentions `institutionIds` or that function at all. So a `DAERAH`/
 * `MITRA BORNEO` article imported through that pipeline lands with ZERO
 * institutions — which is exactly the gap that keeps it off `/daerah/{slug}`
 * and `/mitra/{slug}` (`apps/storefront/src/pages/daerah/[slug].astro`'s own
 * header: "posts reaching this region via an institution's regionCode... see
 * `src/lib/awcms/wilayah.ts`'s file header for why there is no direct
 * post→region field to filter on instead"). Since both routes are literally
 * issue #58's own acceptance criterion, this one, small, HTTP-only follow-up
 * pass stays — it does not create posts and does not convert HTML; it only
 * resolves each post's institution and PATCHes `institutionIds` on it. See
 * `runAssignInstitutions` in the main script.
 *
 * The redirect push is the other legitimate HTTP surface: the CMS's import
 * route is the ONLY way into `awcms_seo_redirects` (no upstream script
 * writes it — `blog:legacy:rubrik-redirects` prints payloads for exactly
 * this route), it is capped at 200 items per all-or-nothing call, and the
 * exporter writes ~51,000 of them. A ~256-call loop with a deterministic
 * `Idempotency-Key` per chunk is a script's job, not an operator's.
 *
 * Same conventions as the seed script, deliberately: `AWCMS_BASE_URL`, the
 * `authorization: Bearer <token>` + `x-awcms-tenant-id` header pair, and the
 * `{ data, raw }` envelope unwrap — so an operator who already knows how to
 * run `bun run db:seed:cms` needs nothing new to run this pass.
