/**
 * Login page render spec (Issue #166) — see skill `awcms-browser-test`.
 *
 * The auto tenant picker (UI/UX phase 2) makes `/login` do ONE best-effort,
 * read-only SSR read of the active tenant registry to choose the tenant field
 * shape. That read is wrapped so any failure (a placeholder `DATABASE_URL` that
 * never connects, an unmigrated DB, an empty registry) degrades to the manual
 * `#tenant-id` TEXT input. This spec needs no fixtures of its own, but the CI
 * e2e-smoke job seeds one tenant before the whole suite runs — with exactly one
 * tenant the picker renders `#tenant-id` as a HIDDEN prefilled input, so this
 * spec asserts the field is ATTACHED (a stable DOM id) rather than visible; its
 * visibility legitimately depends on tenant count. It proves the first `.astro`
 * page renders in
 * a real browser AND that its client script executes under the middleware CSP
 * (`default-src 'self'`): if Astro had inlined the script, CSP would block it
 * and the form's stable ids would still be present but dead — so a follow-up
 * render assertion is not enough on its own; the submit-behaviour path is
 * covered by `admin-offices.e2e.ts` where a seeded session exists.
 *
 * Run: `bun run build && bun run start` (DATABASE_URL may be a placeholder —
 * the tenant read then fails closed to the manual field), then
 * `bun run test:e2e`.
