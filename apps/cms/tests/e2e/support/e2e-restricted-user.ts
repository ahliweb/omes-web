/**
 * Seed a tenant user whose role holds either NOTHING or every read.
 *
 * ## Why this is seeded rather than invited
 *
 * The product path for a second user is an invitation, and its token is stored
 * hashed and delivered by email — a test cannot read it back. So the row is
 * written directly, but through the SAME primitives the owner bootstrap uses
 * (`hashPassword`, `linkIdentityToPrincipal`, the same tables in the same
 * order). A user assembled by hand with a different password hash, or with no
 * principal link, would be testing a shape the login path never produces.
 *
 * `linkIdentityToPrincipal` matters specifically: ADR-0086 moved the lockout
 * counter onto the principal, and an identity with no principal counts no
 * failed logins. Every identity writer links, so this one does too.
 *
 * ## Two grants, two mechanical rules
 *
 * `none` gives an EMPTY role — not "read-only", nothing at all — so every
 * permission-gated screen owes the same answer and one rule covers all of them:
 * the denial renders and the contents do not.
 *
 * `read` gives every tenant-scoped read, a real minimum-privilege operator, and
 * `admin-read-only-access.e2e.ts` is what uses it. That spec was written first
 * and held back for a full round: it failed roughly one run in three for a
 * reason that was not its own — `admin-modules-toggle.e2e.ts` deliberately
 * DISABLES the `reporting` module, and `/admin` authorizes on
 * `reporting.dashboard.read`, so a read sweep overlapping that toggle saw the
 * dashboard correctly deny. The read/write waves (`e2e-waves.ts`) fixed the
 * harness, and the spec landed unchanged.
 *
 * What neither covers is which individual WRITE controls a partially-
 * permissioned user should see. Those expectations differ per screen, so they
 * are per-screen knowledge rather than one rule — stated here so the gap is
 * visible rather than assumed closed.

 * permission catalogue rather than extracted from each page's `authorize`

 * triples rather than one, so a source extractor would have quietly
 * under-granted for those and then blamed the screens for denying.
