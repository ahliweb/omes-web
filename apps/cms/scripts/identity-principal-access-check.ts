/**
 * `bun run identity:principal-access:check` — ADR-0085 (Gelombang 7 PR 7.1) and
 * ADR-0087 (PR 7.3) of Issue #423.
 *
 * The principal tables are GLOBAL and have no RLS. This gate is control 2 of the
 * four that stand in their place, and the distinction it draws is the point:
 *
 *   **RLS bounds which ROWS a query may see. This bounds which CALL SITES may
 *   issue one at all.**
 *
 * Two rules, both structural:
 *
 * 1. **Only allow-listed files may name a guarded table.** A credential store
 *    with readers scattered across the codebase has no boundary to reason about,
 *    and "who can read password hashes" stops being answerable by reading one
 *    file.
 * 2. **Every query in those files is KEYED** — never an unbounded scan and never
 *    `LIKE`. A table that can be scanned is an enumeration endpoint one refactor
 *    away, and unlike a tenant table no RLS policy is there to cut the result
 *    down. For `awcms_principals` that means the credential itself; for the MFA
 *    tables it means a targeting list of who does and does not hold a second
 *    factor.
 *
 * ## One gate, three tables, SEPARATE allow-lists
 *
 * ADR-0087 widened this from one table to three, and deliberately did NOT widen
 * it into one shared permission. Each table names the files that may touch it,
 * so `principal-mfa-store.ts` is not thereby allowed to read `password_hash`
 * and `principal-store.ts` is not allowed to reach into factors. A single fused
 * list would have made "the identity-access module" the boundary, which is not a
 * boundary at all.
 *
 * ## Why it carries synthetic probes
 *
 * Gelombang 1 recorded the failure this avoids: a checker proven only by "it
 * found nothing" is proven by nothing. The allow-lists here are one file each and
 * should stay that way for a long time, so the detector would otherwise spend
 * years never firing — and a matcher that silently stopped matching would look
 * identical. The probes below are DEFECTIVE ON PURPOSE and must all be rejected.
 *
 * Pure: reads source text. No database, no network.

/**
 * How SQL actually names a table: after `FROM`, `INTO`, `UPDATE`, or `JOIN`.
 *
 * ## Why this is not span-based, and the bug that settled it
 *
 * The first two versions of this gate tried to isolate query TEXT — first by
 * pairing backticks, then by also pairing quotes. Both are unsound on real
 * source in this repo, and each was caught by running the gate rather than
 * reading it:
 *
 * - quote pairing breaks on English prose, because an apostrophe in "a human's
 *   login" opens a span that runs to the next apostrophe;
 * - backtick pairing breaks on `scripts/security-readiness.ts`, which contains a
 *   backtick INSIDE a regex character class (`["'\`]`). One unmatched backtick
 *   shifts every pair after it, and a span then covers hundreds of lines.
 *
 * Both produced the same false accusation: a file that merely DECLARES the table
 * in `GLOBAL_TABLE_FORBIDDEN_PRIVILEGES` was reported as querying it.
 *
 * Matching the clause keyword needs no lexing at all. A privilege-map key
 * (`awcms_principals: ["DELETE"]`) and a sentence about the table are not
 * preceded by `FROM`; a query always is.
 *
 * Built per call rather than hoisted: a `g`-flagged regex carries `lastIndex`,
 * and three tables sharing one object is how a scan silently skips a hit.
