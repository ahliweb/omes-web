/**
 * `POST /api/v1/auth/preferences/locale` — switch the UI language for THIS
 * browser, with or without a session (ADR-0095 §"Keputusan 5").
 *
 * ## Why this route touches no database at all
 *
 * It has to work on `/login` and on ADR-0088's tenant-selection screen — the two
 * places a reader most often discovers they are being shown the wrong language,
 * and the two places where no session exists to hang a preference on. So its
 * entire effect is a cookie.
 *
 * That is also why it is not built on `defineSelfServiceTenantRoute`: that
 * factory requires a bearer and answers `onUnauthenticated` without it, which is
 * precisely the caller this endpoint exists to serve. And because it opens no
 * tenant transaction, it needs no entry on `api:tenant-route:check`'s allowlist —
 * that ledger may only shrink, and a route with no database work has nothing to
 * put on it.
 *
 * The DURABLE half of the feature lives at `POST /api/v1/auth/preferences`, which
 * IS a self-service tenant route because persisting against a principal genuinely
 * requires knowing who is asking. `AdminLayout` points the switcher there; the
 * unauthenticated screens point it here. Both set the same cookie, so switching
 * language behaves identically either side of the login boundary.
 *
 * ## CSRF, stated rather than assumed
 *
 * A cross-origin form POST here can change which of two catalogs a reader is
 * shown. That is the entire impact: cosmetic, immediately visible, and undone by
 * one click. The cookie is deliberately not `HttpOnly` (see `request-locale.ts`),
 * so same-origin script could set it anyway, and there is no server state to
 * corrupt. A token here would add a failure mode to the one control a reader
 * looking at the wrong language needs to work.
