/**
 * security-readiness.ts — `bun run security:readiness`.
 *
 * Issue #142. Ported from awcms-mini's own `scripts/security-readiness.ts`
 * and adapted to THIS repo's real surface (no tax/CRM/AI/POS/analytics/social
 * modules here, no `docker-compose.yml`, no per-area `checkXxxConfig`
 * exports in `scripts/validate-env.ts`). Runs a fixed list of named security
 * checks against the REAL codebase/database/environment — every check below
 * is backed by a real signal (a DB query, a grep over tracked source files,
 * a call into a real domain function, or an env var read). None of them are
 * hardcoded to "pass".
 *
 * ## Why this script exists (the bug it is built to catch)
 *
 * Migrations 002-008 and 010-012 shipped 23 tenant-scoped tables with only
 * `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and never `FORCE` — PostgreSQL lets a table's
 * OWNER bypass RLS unless `FORCE` is set, and this app connects as the
 * migration owner. So `awcms_*_tenant_isolation` policies were never
 * evaluated: RLS was inert for two years' worth of migrations and NOT ONE
 * check caught it (found by manual audit, fixed by `sql/017`). The
 * `"RLS enabled AND forced on tenant-scoped tables"` check below exists
 * precisely so that class of regression fails loudly the next time: it
 * requires `relforcerowsecurity`, not just `relrowsecurity`. Its companion
 * `"App DB connection role does not bypass RLS"` closes the other half —
 * `FORCE` still does nothing against a SUPERUSER/BYPASSRLS connection role.
 *
 * ## Gate rule
 *
 * Any `critical` check with `status: "fail"` blocks go-live (non-zero exit
 * code). `warning`/`info` findings are printed but never block.
 *
 * ## Not part of `bun run check`
 *
 * Deliberately: the DB-backed checks need a real, migrated database, and
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has no Postgres service. This is an operator/
 * go-live command (run it with the APP's `DATABASE_URL`, not a privileged
 * migration/superuser URL — see `checkAppDbUserNotSuperuser`), and it is
 * wired into the `logging` module's job descriptor list, not into the
 * per-commit lint gate. `OUT_OF_SCOPE_ITEMS` below records the checklist
 * items that genuinely cannot be automated from this repo alone, with a
 * reason each — never silently dropped.

 *
 * - the line does NOT mention `process.env` (a fallback like
 *   `token: process.env.TOKEN ?? "..."` reads from env, not hardcoded);
 * - the assignment is not a member-expression write like `url.password =

 *   `scripts/db-migrate.ts` masks a URL password with the literal `"****"`,
 *   which is a redaction placeholder, not a secret;
 * - the literal isn't an obvious placeholder (`change-me`, `xxx`, `***`,
 *   `...`, `redacted`, `todo`) or an i18n/error-code lookup key.
 *
 * Known limitations (documented, not silently hidden):
 * - Cannot see through string concatenation, or through the VALUE of a
 *   template literal it skips (see `TEMPLATE_INTERPOLATION_MARKER` below): a
 *   secret assembled at runtime from pieces is invisible to a line regex.
 * - A variable whose name merely contains one of the four keywords is the
 *   dominant false-positive source, and this repo has ELEVEN of them — not
 *   zero, as this comment claimed until the exclusions below were written.
 *   They fall into exactly three shapes (a string-literal UNION type, a
 *   `_PREFIX`/`_HEADER`/`_ACTION` constant naming a wire label rather than
 *   holding a credential, and an interpolated template literal), each excluded
 *   narrowly and separately below. Anything outside those three shapes still
 *   fires, including on a name ending in one of the three suffixes.
 * - Only scans `src/`, `scripts/`, and root config files. `tests/` is
 *   excluded so test fixtures never count as findings.

/**
 * Single source of truth for every GLOBAL, RLS-free table. Maps each table's
 * name to the privileges `awcms_app` must NOT hold on it at runtime — and, by
 * its KEYS, defines the set of `awcms_%` tables that are intentionally RLS-free
 * because they are not tenant-scoped (no per-tenant row ownership). Derived by
 * reading `sql/*.sql` directly, not guessed: these are exactly the `awcms_%`
 * tables that are `CREATE TABLE`d but never `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`d.
 *
 * - `awcms_schema_migrations` (sql/001) — migration bookkeeping ledger.
 * - `awcms_modules` (sql/008) — global module registry, no `tenant_id`.
 * - `awcms_module_dependencies`, `awcms_module_navigation`,
 *   `awcms_module_jobs`, `awcms_module_health_checks` (sql/008) —
 *   code-derived module registry metadata (dependency graph, admin nav,
 *   job/command catalog, instance-level health check history), synced from
 *   trusted per-module descriptors (each module's own `module.ts`), never
 *   tenant-writable.
 * - `awcms_tenants` (sql/002) — the tenant table itself; each row IS a
 *   tenant, it does not belong to one. `sql/017`'s header and
 *   `src/lib/jobs/batching.ts` both rely on this being RLS-free.
 * - `awcms_permissions` (sql/005) — global `module.activity.action`
 *   permission catalog, shared by every tenant.
 * - `awcms_setup_state` (sql/006) — global singleton setup lock that exists
 *   before any tenant does.
 *
 * ## Why ONE map, not two lists (Issue #162 / L2)
 *
 * This used to be two independent structures: an `RLS_FREE_TABLES` set (read by
 * `checkRlsEnabled`) plus a separate forbidden-privilege map (read by
 * `checkRuntimeRoleGrants`). The auditor of PR #161 flagged the "one-list
 * omission" gap: a future global RLS-free table added to the SET (to satisfy
 * `checkRlsEnabled`) but forgotten in the forbidden-privilege MAP was
 * `continue`d as "full DML kept by design" and passed silently — the exact "a
 * new global table inherits blanket DML from `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`"
 * regression this whole check exists to catch. Merging them means you cannot
 * register a table in one place without the other: adding a key here FORCES an
 * explicit privilege declaration for it, and `checkRuntimeRoleGrants` fails
 * closed ("assert zero write") on any RLS-free table still missing one.
 *
 * The value is the list of privileges FORBIDDEN for `awcms_app`:
 * - `[]` — full DML legitimately kept. The five module-registry tables are
 *   written at request time by `descriptor-sync.ts`/`health-registry.ts` (see
 *   `sql/021`'s header). A DELIBERATE, explicit "allow" a reviewer can see and
 *   challenge — not an implicit default.
 * - `["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]` — read-only at runtime, every write
 *   forbidden: `awcms_permissions` (global permission catalog, never written by
 *   the app) and `awcms_schema_migrations` (migration ledger, only `db:migrate`
 *   as owner writes it).
 * - `["DELETE"]` — keep SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, forbid DELETE only:
 *   `awcms_tenants` (tenant-settings write path + setup-fallback bootstrap) and
 *   `awcms_setup_state` (setup-fallback singleton).
 *
 * Anything NOT keyed here that matches `awcms_%` is treated as tenant-scoped and
 * MUST have both `relrowsecurity` and `relforcerowsecurity` (`checkRlsEnabled`)
 * AND all four grants (`checkRuntimeRoleGrants`). That default-deny direction is
 * the point: a new migration adding a tenant table needs no registration to be
 * protected; a new genuinely-global table is the one case that requires a
 * deliberate edit here, with a reason — the correct place to force that
 * conversation.

 *   at runtime. The `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`-is-executing-role-bound gap.
 * - OVER-granted: a global RLS-free table where `awcms_app` still holds a
 *   forbidden write — the residual #160 closes, and its regression guard for a
 *   FUTURE global table silently inheriting blanket DML from default privileges.
 *
 * The over-granted direction is FAIL-CLOSED (Issue #162 / L2): a table that is
 * RLS-free (present in `rlsFreeTables`) but carries NO explicit privilege
 * declaration in `forbiddenPrivileges` is asserted to hold ZERO writes. Any
 * write it does hold is reported as an over-grant with a "register the allowed
 * privileges" message, rather than being skipped as "full DML by design". This
 * closes the exact gap the auditor of #161 flagged: a future global table added
 * to the RLS-free set but forgotten in the forbidden-privilege map now FAILS
 * instead of passing silently.
 *
 * Uses `has_table_privilege(role, oid, priv)` so it reports the EFFECTIVE grant
 * (direct + default-privilege + PUBLIC), which is what the runtime actually
 * gets — reading `relacl` directly would miss default-privilege grants. The
 * function is available to any role and does not require membership in the
 * checked role, so this runs correctly even when `security:readiness` is run
 * AS `awcms_app` (the recommended way to run it).
 *
 * Non-blocking when `awcms_app` does not exist: a database migrated before
 * `sql/019` legitimately has no such role, and a `critical` fail there would
 * cry wolf over a merely-un-migrated state — the missing-role signal is already
 * the job of `checkLeastPrivilegeRoleProvisioned` (warning). Once the role

// SSO break-glass accounts are STILL eligible for every locked-down tenant
// (Issue #185 residual) — critical
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The other half of the break-glass guarantee, and the half nothing enforced
 * until now.
 *
 * `saveTenantAuthPolicy` refuses (409 `BREAK_GLASS_REQUIRED`) to store a policy
 * with `sso_required=true` or `password_login_enabled=false` unless at least
 * one named break-glass identity is eligible AT THAT MOMENT. That is a
 * save-time check, and eligibility is not a property of the policy — it is a
 * property of two other tables. Deactivating the identity (`/api/v1/users/{id}`
 * → `status='inactive'`) or removing its tenant membership makes the stored
 * policy false without the policy ever being touched, and both are ordinary
 * user-administration actions that no one performing them would connect to SSO
 * lockout. The tenant is then one IdP outage away from having no way in at all,
 * and every existing check still reports green.
 *
 * So this re-derives eligibility from the live database at go-live time. It
 * calls `fetchEligibleBreakGlassIdentityIds` and `evaluateBreakGlassRequirement`
 * — the SAME functions the save path uses, not a second copy of the rule. A
 * reimplementation here would be free to drift from the endpoint, which is the
 * failure mode this check exists to catch, one level up.
 *
 * ## Why it runs one transaction per tenant
 *
 * `awcms_tenant_auth_policies` is FORCE RLS keyed on `app.current_tenant_id`,
 * so there is no cross-tenant read for the app role — by design. Enumerating
 * tenants from the RLS-free `awcms_tenants` and entering `withTenant` per
 * tenant is not a workaround for that; it is the check running under exactly
 * the isolation the application runs under. A version that could see every
 * policy in one query would be a version connecting as a role that bypasses
 * RLS, which `checkAppDbUserNotSuperuser` exists to forbid.
 *
 * ## Why every active tenant, uncapped
 *
 * A cap would mean a locked-out tenant past the limit goes unreported while
 * the check prints PASS — the precise shape of "green gate, wrong answer".
 * Inactive tenants are skipped because they have no live login surface to be
 * locked out of; the count scanned is always reported.
 *
 * `critical`, for both triggers, because neither is a configuration the API
 * will produce: `saveTenantAuthPolicy` returns 409 for both, so any occurrence
 * is drift rather than intent. The two are not equally urgent, though, and the
 * evidence says which one each tenant has — `password_login_enabled=false`
 * leaves the tenant reachable only through the IdP right now, while
 * `sso_required=true` alone is advisory (password login still works, see
 * `docs/awcms/oidc-sso.md` §3) and is the same fault waiting for someone to
 * turn password login off.

 * Gap C3: this repo compresses nothing at any layer it owns, and the readers
 * of both deployed environments nevertheless receive `content-encoding: gzip`
 * — from Cloudflare, which sits in front of Traefik (`environments.md` §Cache
 * tepi, probed 4 August 2026). Both halves are true, and the dangerous one is
 * the second: a deployment of this base that is NOT behind a compressing CDN
 * serves every byte of HTML, JSON, `sitemap.xml` and `feed.xml` uncompressed,
 * and nothing in the repo says so.
 *
 * C3's own prescription offered two closures — assert `Content-Encoding` once
 * compression moves to a layer this repo owns, OR record the dependency in
 * `security:readiness`. The assessment (§9.3) withdrew the first as a
 * recommendation rather than deferring it: Cloudflare already compresses, so
 * adding a second compressor here creates precisely the "two places deciding
 * the same thing" this repo refuses elsewhere. So this is the second closure —
 * and it is a check, not a sentence, because a hand-written note goes stale in
 * both directions:
 *
 * - if someone later enables compression here, the note keeps claiming every
 *   byte comes from the CDN → the first branch below detects it and says so;
 * - if the note itself is deleted or rewritten past recognition, the
 *   dependency becomes invisible again → the last branch fails.
 *
 * `warning`, never `critical`: uncompressed responses are slow, not unsafe,
 * and the deployed topology today does compress. What must not happen is that
 * an operator reaches go-live without ever being told the compression belongs
 * to a layer this repo neither ships nor checks.
