 * refused — never silently retried as a session token.
 *
 * The canonical header for human sessions stays `x-awcms-tenant-id`. No alias
 * is accepted: every future route would have to honour every spelling, and an

  // "an author may update their own not-yet-published post even without
  // `blog_content.posts.update`". Before this seam existed, the three routes
  // implementing that rule could not sit behind this function at all — it
  // returns `denied` before any domain rule is consulted — so they evaluated
  // permissions themselves and silently lost ABAC, the platform-scope gate,
  // business-scope facts and SoD along with it.
  //
  // Widening the key set here rather than short-circuiting is what keeps every
  // one of those intact, and the ORDER inside `evaluateAccess` is what makes it
  // safe: an ABAC `deny` is matched BEFORE the RBAC key check, so an ownership
  // grant can never overrule an explicit deny. Deny-overrides-allow still holds.
  //
  // A machine credential is deliberately excluded: it AUTHENTICATES and never
  // AUTHORIZES (ADR-0049 §3), so a build token pointed at an author's account
  // must not inherit that author's ownership.

/**
 * Secondary FIELD-level access check, reusing a context already authorized by
 * `authorizeInTransaction`.
 *
 * The primary guard decides whether a caller may reach an endpoint at all; some
 * endpoints then expose extra DE-ANONYMIZING fields behind a SEPARATE permission
 * (e.g. `visitor_analytics.raw_detail.read`). Gating those on
 * `grantedPermissionKeys.has(fieldKey)` alone checks only RBAC membership and
 * silently ignores the ABAC layer — so a `deny` DSL policy on the field key would
 * NOT be honored (deny-overrides-allow bypassed for the field). This routes the
 * field decision through the SAME `evaluateAccess` used for the primary action,
 * so RBAC grant AND no applicable ABAC deny are both required. Returns a plain
 * boolean (never a Response): a denied field is omitted from the response, not an
 * endpoint-level 403.
 *
 * Reuses the caller's already-resolved `context`/`grantedPermissionKeys` and the
 * tenant's active policies (tenant-keyed cache — no extra session/permission
 * round-trips). It deliberately records NO decision log: this is a projection
 * refinement of an already-logged allowed decision, not a separate
 * resource-access decision. `fieldGuard.action` must be a read-only action (this
 * never runs the high-risk SoD chokepoint).
