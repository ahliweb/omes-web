/**
 * Job-side work-class registry (Issue #743, epic #738 platform-evolution).
 * Complements the ROUTE-side registry, which is entirely GENERATED (see
 * `scripts/work-class-registry-generate.ts` — every `src/pages/api/v1/**`
 * route that calls `withTenant(...)` already declares its work class
 * inline, either explicitly or by relying on the documented default, so
 * generating a snapshot from that source is strictly more reliable than a
 * second hand-maintained copy).
 *
 * Background jobs (`scripts/*.ts` that call `getWorkerDatabaseClient()`/
 * `getSetupDatabaseClient()`) have no equivalent inline declaration to
 * generate FROM, so this is a small, hand-authored, DECLARATIVE map: which
 * work-class "bucket" each job's connection usage is attributed to.
 *
 * ## What "declared" means here, corrected 22 August 2026
 *
 * This header used to say jobs "do not call `withTenant`/`acquireWorkClassSlot`
 * at all today", and the capacity runbook said the same. **That was written
 * when it was true and stayed after it stopped being true.** Jobs open tenant
 * transactions through `withTenantOrThrow` — which is `acquireWorkClassSlot`,
 * the same pool gate a request goes through — and finding D11 found seven
 * scripts passing no class at all, so a nightly purge attributed its pool
 * pressure to the bucket that serves live users, and one script passing
 * `maintenance` where this map says `background_sync`.
 *
 * So the map is no longer only a capacity-planning label: for a script that
 * opens its own transactions, the class here is the class the script must
 * PASS, and `db:work-class:generate` refuses to run when it does not (in both
 * directions — a missing option and a contradicting one). What the gate cannot
 * see is a script whose transactions live in a job module under `src/`; those
 * have no call of their own to inspect, and the rationales below that claim
 * "every call inside <module> already passes it explicitly" are not verified
 * by it.
 *
 * ## Job concurrency is still bounded by something else, and that is unchanged
 *
 * `src/lib/jobs/job-runner.ts`'s Postgres advisory lock ensures at most ONE
 * instance of a given job NAME runs cluster-wide at a time, which is the
 * dominant connection-storm risk for scheduled jobs (an overlapping re-run of
 * the SAME job — a slow purge still running when the next cron tick fires).
 * The work class governs which bounded queue the job's transactions wait in;
 * the advisory lock governs how many of the job there are. Neither replaces
 * the other.
 *
 * `scripts/work-class-registry-check.ts` discovers the CURRENT set of
 * worker scripts by grepping `scripts/*.ts` for `getWorkerDatabaseClient(`/
 * `getSetupDatabaseClient(` (ground truth — independent of whether a
 * module's `jobs:` descriptor also happens to list the script) and fails if
 * any discovered file is missing from this map, or if this map contains a
 * stale entry for a file that no longer exists/no longer opens a worker
 * connection.
