/**
 * Subscription storage for `push_delivery` (Issue #465).
 *
 * Every function here takes an ALREADY-OPEN transaction (`tx`) rather than the
 * pool, so a caller can register a subscription in the same transaction that
 * authorized the request — the shape `loadAdminScreen` and `defineTenantRoute`
 * both rely on, and the reason R3 (#450) moved every admin screen to decide and
 * read atomically. The HTTP surface that will use it lands in its own issue;
 * the dispatcher and the purge job are its callers today.
 *
 * The raw `endpoint` column is selected in exactly ONE place —
 * `fetchDeliveryTarget`, which the dispatcher calls immediately before handing
 * it to a provider. Every other read here projects `endpoint_masked`. That is a
 * rule this file can actually keep, because it is the only file that mentions
 * the column.

 * ## Why this is not `disablePushSubscription`
 *
 * That one records what the PUSH SERVICE said. This one records what the PERSON
 * said, and the two differ in what may be kept. A subscription disabled because
 * the endpoint is gone keeps its endpoint: the value is dead, and it is the
 * evidence for "why did this device stop". A subscription the user revoked is
 * one where the endpoint may still be perfectly usable — so continuing to store
 * it means holding a live push credential for a device whose owner asked us to
 * stop. The row survives (an operator still needs to see that the device was
 * revoked and when); the credential does not.
 *
 * ## Why the RFC 8291 key material is left in place
 *
 * The obvious next line — null `p256dh_key` and `auth_secret` too — would
 * violate `awcms_push_subscriptions_keys_match_transport_check`, which requires
 * a `web_push` row to carry both. More to the point it would buy nothing: both
 * values are inputs to encrypting a payload for an endpoint, and the endpoint
 * is what was just destroyed. They cannot address anything on their own. The
 * constraint is therefore left alone rather than weakened to permit a delete
 * that has no effect.
 *
 * ## Ownership is in the WHERE clause
 *
 * `tenant_user_id` is matched, not checked afterwards, so a caller cannot
 * revoke somebody else's device by guessing an id — and the caller cannot learn
 * whether the id exists, because "not yours" and "not there" both return
 * `{ revoked: false }` and the route answers both with the same 404.
