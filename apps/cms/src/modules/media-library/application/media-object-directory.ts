 * Every function here takes an already tenant-scoped `Bun.SQL`/`Bun.TransactionSQL`
 * (from `withTenant`, `lib/database/tenant-context.ts`) — none of them open
 * their own transaction, matching the rest of this repo's directories.
 *
 * Out of scope here (Issue #634): actually talking to R2 (presign, HEAD/GET,
 * streaming PUT) — every status transition below is a plain metadata
 * UPDATE; the caller is responsible for having done the real R2 work first
 * (ADR-0006: provider calls never happen inside a DB transaction).
 *
 * Audit events are written for exactly the actions that still exist here:
 * create, verify, delete, restore, purge (skill `awcms-audit-log`). The epic's
 * original list also named attach/detach; ADR-0056 §A removed both, since
 * ADR-0036 moved the relation they wrote to the consumer's own FK — see the
 * marker where those two functions used to be. The intermediate
 * `pending_upload -> uploaded`
 * and any `-> orphaned`/`-> failed` transition are logged via the structured
 * logger only (`src/lib/logging/logger.ts`) — see `markNewsMediaObjectUploaded`/
 * `markNewsMediaObjectFailed` below for why

 *
 * `GET /api/v1/media/objects` demands `?ids=`: it is a batch RESOLVER, built
 * for `awcms-astro` to swap ids for URLs at build time, and it answers only for
 * objects safe to reference publicly. Before this function the application
 * layer had `fetchNewsMediaObjectById`, `fetchNewsMediaObjectsByIds`, and
 * `fetchNewsMediaObjectByObjectKey` — every one a point lookup. There was no
 * way to ask "what media does this tenant have", so a browse screen could not
 * be built on the existing surface at all, whatever the permissions said.
 *
 * Teaching the resolver a no-`ids` mode would turn a request that is a 400
 * today into a dump of the whole registry — a contract change wearing the
 * clothes of an addition. Hence a separate function and a separate route.
 *
 * ## Deliberately unlike the resolver
 *
 * This returns rows in ANY status, including `pending_upload` and `failed`,
 * and (when asked) soft-deleted ones. That is the opposite of
 * `isNewsMediaObjectSafeForPublicReference`, and it is correct here: an
 * administrator's reason to open this list is usually the objects that are NOT
 * healthy. The `media.read` guard is what keeps that inside the tenant, and no
 * caller of this function may use its rows as a public reference — use the port
 * for that.
 *
 * The cursor carries FULL-PRECISION `created_at` text
 * (`keysetCursorCreatedAtSql()`), never a JS `Date`, so a page boundary
 * cannot skip rows sharing a millisecond — the trap this repo already paid for
 * (Issue #158), and one a media registry walks straight into, since a batch
 * upload writes many rows inside the same millisecond.

 * consumer's permission. Nothing in `src/`, `scripts/`, or `tests/` had called
 * either function.
 *

 * admits it and `isNewsMediaObjectSafeForPublicReference` still treats it as

 * It is a leftover of the pre-ADR-0036 model, the same one that took

 * column silently deletes a live image after the grace period. That is a
 * feature with a real design in it, not a repair, and it is not what the
 * unreachable code was.
 *
 * The STATUS survives in `sql/041`'s CHECK, alongside `orphaned_at` and its
 * partial index. An applied migration is immutable, the column stays honest
 * about what the schema will hold, and it is where a future detector would

 *
 * The reconciliation job owns the bucket. Deleting bytes here would put two

 * the job already has the ordering discipline for it (see
 * `scripts/news-media-r2-reconcile.ts`). The accepted, stated cost is a window

 *
 * ## Why a savepoint, and why no pre-check
 *
 * `awcms_news_portal_ad_placements.media_object_id` is a hard, NOT NULL FK to
 * this table with no `ON DELETE` clause — so purging a still-referenced object
 * raises `23503`. In PostgreSQL that ABORTS the transaction: every later
 * statement fails with "current transaction is aborted", and the COMMIT
 * `withTenant` performs on a returned 4xx fails too. Catching the error without
 * a savepoint turns a caller-actionable 409 into a 500.
 *
 * There is deliberately no pre-check SELECT to go with it — unlike
 * `provisionTenant`, which pre-checks then uses the savepoint only for the race.
 * A pre-check here would have to name the referencing tables, i.e. this module
 * would have to know its own CONSUMERS (`module.ts`: "media must never depend on
 * its own consumers"). Letting the FK answer keeps that knowledge in the
 * database, where it already lives, and stays correct the day a second module
 * adds a reference.
