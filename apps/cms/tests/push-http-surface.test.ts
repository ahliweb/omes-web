/**
 * The push HTTP surface (Issue #466).
 *
 * Two kinds of assertion here, and the split is deliberate.
 *
 * The VALIDATOR is pure, so it is exercised directly with real inputs — the
 * cheapest and strongest evidence available.
 *
 * The ROUTES are not testable end to end without a database and a session, and
 * the properties that matter most about them are structural: that the recipient
 * of a notification is never read from the request, that ownership is a WHERE
 * clause rather than a post-hoc comparison, that a machine credential is
 * refused before any database work. Those are asserted against source text, and
 * each such assertion is written to fail when the property is removed rather
 * than when the wording changes — the trap this repo has hit three times, where
 * a check matched the very comment explaining what the code no longer does.
