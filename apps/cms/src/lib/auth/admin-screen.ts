/**
 * `loadAdminScreen` (issue #450, PROJECT_STATE §4 R3) — the one place an admin
 * screen's access decision and its data read happen, in that order, inside one
 * transaction.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * All 32 `src/pages/admin/**\/*.astro` files decided what to render from
 * `ssr.permissions.has(...)`. That set is `fetchGrantedPermissionKeys` — raw
 * RBAC. It skips `authorizeInTransaction`, and therefore skips everything that
 * only exists there: ABAC policy evaluation (a tenant's `deny` written through
 * `/api/v1/access/policies` was enforced on the API and inert on the screen),
 * `resolveModuleAvailability` (a tenant that disabled a module still saw its
 * screen full of data), business-scope facts, action-time SoD, and
 * `recordDecisionLog` — so a read that happened left no row saying it did.
 *
 * What was NOT lost, stated so the finding is not inflated: basic RBAC still
 * held, and there was never cross-tenant leakage — `withTenantOrThrow` and
 * FORCE RLS were always in the path.
 *
 * ## Why it must be fixed before scoped grants (Gelombang 3)
 *
 * Today `ssr.permissions` answers "is this key granted anywhere". Once a grant
 * carries its own scope, that stops meaning "may read THIS", and R3 turns from
 * a missing policy layer into real read-side over-disclosure.
 *
 * ## Why this EXECUTES instead of returning a wrapper
 *
 * `defineTenantRoute` returns an `APIRoute` because a route module exports a
 * handler that something else calls. An `.astro` frontmatter has no handler to
 * wrap — it is a script that runs top-to-bottom — so the honest shape is a
 * function the page awaits. The program plan called this `defineAdminScreen`;
 * the name changed rather than the shape being bent to fit it.
 *
 * ## One transaction, and the order inside it
 *
 * `authorizeInTransaction` and `load` share one `tx`. Splitting them would mean
 * deciding against one snapshot and reading against another — and once grants
 * carry scope, the scope filter a decision computed could be applied to rows
 * fetched under a different one. It is also the same connection discipline
 * `defineTenantRoute` documents: `tx` is ONE reserved connection, so `load`
 * must `await` in sequence and never `Promise.all` over it.
 *
 * ## Deny RENDERS, it does not redirect
 *
 * Over twenty `tests/admin-*-page-contract.test.ts` assert a denied element id
 * (`#users-denied`, `#form-drafts-denied`, …). A redirect would also hand a
 * tenant that authored a `deny` policy a login loop instead of a refusal. So
 * the outcome is data for the template, never a `Response`.
 *
 * ## `error` is a THIRD state, never a denial
 *
 * `withTenantOrThrow` throws when the pool or circuit breaker refuses. A
 * refusal rendered as "you may not see this" is a lie in the direction that
 * gets investigated as a permissions bug; rendered as "there are no rows" it is
 * worse. Screens already distinguish this (`loadError`), and the type keeps
 * them honest by making the three outcomes mutually exclusive.

/**
 * A screen whose subject IS the caller, and which therefore has no entry
 * permission to evaluate (ADR-0096 §1).
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate function and not a flag on `loadAdminScreen`
 *
 * A boolean like `authorize: "none"` would make the AUTHORIZING helper
 * sometimes not authorize, and every reader of every screen would then have to
 * check which mode a given call is in before believing anything about it. The
 * two operations are genuinely different — one decides access, this one has no
 * access decision to make — so they get different names.
 *
 * `authorize: []` is not the answer either: `selectEntryOutcome` DENIES an empty
 * list, fail-closed and deliberately ("no request authorizes this page" must
 * never read as "any request does"). That rule stays exactly as it is.
 *
 * ## Why not just invent a permission
 *
 * That is the trap ADR-0058 §E names. `identity_access.own_account.read` would
 * be an action no migration seeds, so it would deny EVERYONE — tenant owner
 * included — while the call site read as correctly guarded. A person locked out
 * of their own password-change screen is the worst possible place to discover
 * it.
 *
 * ## What this still does
 *
 * Everything except the decision: opens ONE tenant transaction under a declared
 * work class, so RLS applies and the screen cannot open its own; funnels errors
 * through `onError`; and returns the same `error` state so callers degrade
 * identically. There is no `denied` state, because nothing here can deny.
 *
 * ## The bound on its use
 *
 * `tests/admin-screen-self-service.test.ts` enumerates the screens allowed to
 * call it, with a reason each. That list is the control: without it, this
 * function is a way to put an unauthorized screen under `/admin` and still
 * satisfy `access:chokepoint:check`. It is meant to stay one entry long.
