/**
 * admin-screen-coverage-check.ts — `bun run admin:screen-coverage:check`.
 *
 * Every declared permission is claimed by an admin screen, or is a written
 * decision, or sits on a ledger that may only shrink. Pure: registry + source
 * text, no database, no network.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * [ADR-0051](../docs/adr/0051-admin-screens-consolidated-in-awcms.md) decided
 * every SYSTEM admin screen belongs in this repo, and then nothing measured
 * compliance. The checks that look adjacent answer different questions:
 *
 * - `access:permissions:enforcement:check` — "does this permission have an
 *   ENFORCER?" A route counts. A `curl`-only surface passes it forever.
 * - `tests/admin-navigation-registry.test.ts` — "does every `navigation` entry
 *   point at a page, and vice versa?" A module with no `navigation` has nothing
 *   to check.
 * - per-screen contract tests — "does THIS screen gate the right keys?" They
 *   cannot see a permission no screen mentions.
 *
 * So "usable only via `curl`" was found by hand, repeatedly, and each time it
 * was found it was found late. One mechanical scan surfaces it in a second.
 *
 * ## What this gate does NOT answer
 *
 * It asks whether a screen CLAIMS a permission — never whether the control is
 * correct. `/admin/blog`'s Restore button claimed `posts.restore` while being
 * rendered on rows that could only 404 (#351); this gate would have said
 * "covered" throughout. Correctness is the per-screen contract test's job, and
 * the two answer different questions on purpose.
 *
 * ## Why the matcher resolves file-local helpers
 *
 * A matcher keyed on literal `permissionKey("mod","activity","action")` triples
 * alone reports `blog_content`'s templates/menus/widgets/theme as unclaimed:
 * `blog-presentation.astro` binds `const can = (activity, action) =>
 * ssr.permissions.has(permissionKey("blog_content", activity, action))` and
 * calls it eight times with literals. Reporting a claimed permission as
 * unclaimed is the failure mode that has already cost this repo four rewrites of
 * `permission-enforcement-check.ts` and two exception entries written up as
 * decisions — a scanner that answers "uncovered" for something covered trains
 * its readers to widen the exception list until it asks nothing.
 *
 * Resolution is therefore FILE-FIRST and deliberately narrow: a helper counts
 * only when its body binds the module key as a LITERAL and forwards its own two
 * parameters. Anything else is left unresolved rather than guessed at.
