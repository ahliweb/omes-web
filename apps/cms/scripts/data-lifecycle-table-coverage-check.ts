/**
 * `bun run data-lifecycle:table-coverage:check` — issue #437.
 *
 * Every `awcms_*` table must have ANSWERED the retention question. Not
 * answered it the same way — answered it at all.
 *
 * ## Why this is not the gate the issue asked for
 *
 * #437 asked for a gate over "high-volume tables" whose list is DERIVED rather
 * than hand-written, because a hand-written list is green forever for the
 * high-volume table nobody remembered to add. That reasoning still holds. What
 * does not hold is the premise that such a derivation exists here. Three were
 * built and measured against this schema before this one:
 *
 * 1. **Append-only in source** (a table the code only ever `INSERT`s into).
 *    46 tables, and wrong in both directions: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
 *    reads as an append while being a bounded upsert, and the retention engine
 *    deletes through an interpolated `${tableName}` the scanner cannot see.
 * 2. **No deletion path** (never `DELETE`d, no cascading parent). 94 tables —
 *    because this schema uses `ON DELETE CASCADE` in exactly ONE migration, so
 *    "no cascade" describes almost everything and distinguishes nothing.
 * 3. **Unbounded by schema** (no UNIQUE constraint over entity columns). 121 of
 *    128. Real bounded tables key on curated text (`module_key`, `slug`,
 *    `tenant_code`), which is not a foreign key and cannot be told apart from a
 *    free-form value by looking at the DDL.
 *
 * A gate whose exemption list is 90% of the schema is the hand-written list
 * wearing a costume. So the question changed: instead of deriving WHICH tables
 * are high-volume — which requires knowing how the product is used — derive
 * only that a table EXISTS, and make the obligation impossible to skip.
 *
 * ## The shape, and why forgetting is impossible
 *
 * The table set comes from `sql/` via `deriveTableRlsStates` — the same
 * function `repo:inventory` uses, deliberately, so there is one answer to "what
 * tables are there" and not two that can drift.
 *
 * A table passes four ways, and a NEW table has only three of them:
 *
 * - a `dataLifecycle` descriptor — declared by the owning module, or (ADR-0076)
 *   in `INFRASTRUCTURE_LIFECYCLE_DESCRIPTORS` when the table is owned by
 *   `src/lib/` and has no module to declare it. `data-lifecycle:registry:check`
 *   validates the contents of both and proves the second kind really is
 *   infrastructure-owned; this gate only asks whether one exists;
 * - SEALED AGAINST GROWTH — derived, not written down: no role holds INSERT on
 *   it anywhere in `sql/`, so its row count cannot grow at runtime. See
 *   `deriveSealedTables`. This is the one answer nobody has to remember to give,
 *   and the one a reviewer can check by running a query instead of by trusting
 *   a sentence;
 * - `BOUNDED_BY_DESIGN` — a reasoned refusal. **Starts empty.** A new bounded
 *   table joins it with a sentence a reviewer can disagree with;
 * - `TABLES_PREDATING_THE_RULE` — the tables that already existed. It may
 *   only SHRINK, and an entry that has since gained a descriptor is an error,
 *   not a tolerated duplicate.
 *
 * The derived pass arrived last and PAID for itself on the way in: it retired
 * three `BOUNDED_BY_DESIGN` entries whose prose argued exactly what it derives
 * (`awcms_entitlements`, `awcms_plans`, `awcms_plan_entitlements`) and five
 * ledger entries besides. A hand-written answer that the database already
 * enforces is not a second opinion — it is a copy that can go stale.
 *
 * The ledger carries no per-entry reason on purpose. One reason covers all of
 * them — they predate the rule — and inventing 114 individual justifications
 * would manufacture exactly the fiction this file exists to avoid. Its length
 * is a debt counter, printed on every run.
 *
 * What this cannot do is tell you that an EXISTING table on that ledger is
 * quietly eating the disk. It was never going to: that is a question about
 * traffic, and the honest place to answer it is `security:readiness` against a
 * real database, not a pure gate in the `check` chain.
 *
 * Pure: reads `sql/`, `listModules()`, and the infrastructure registry. No
 * database, no network.

The row has no natural expiry and its age says nothing about whether it is still wanted; deleting it would blank the published contact details of a live site.

An age-based purge would be actively WRONG here: `executionMode: 'generic'` deletes purely by age with no status predicate, so it would delete LIVE grants, and a revoked row is the only record that answers 'did this person have access last March' — the question an audit actually asks.

It therefore cannot grow faster than `awcms_identities` — which sits on the predating ledger — and is strictly SMALLER, because one human in three tenants is three identities and one principal.

A descriptor of its own would be actively wrong — `executionMode: 'generic'` deletes purely by age, so it would strip the roles off a still-pending invitation and produce an acceptance that silently grants nothing. Its own ceiling is bounded twice over anyway: at most one row per (invitation, role, scope) by unique index, and at most 20 roles per invitation by `MAX_INVITATION_ROLE_COUNT`."

The reason a descriptor is not merely unnecessary but WRONG is the one this list keeps rediscovering: `executionMode: 'generic'` deletes purely by age with no status predicate, so it would deregister live partners — and every `awcms_partner_managed_tenants` row naming them is FK-bound, so the delete would either fail or, if someone 'fixed' it with a cascade, silently sever every customer engagement in the installation."

At most one row per (tenant, partner) by unique index, and the partner side is FK-bound to a registry that is itself operator-authored, so the ceiling is tenants x registered partners with both factors human-authored. It is not a log: severing an engagement is a DELETE (ADR-0089 chose hard delete precisely so no dead mapping can be resurrected by a bug), so the table holds the present, and 'who reached into this tenant last March' is answered by `awcms_audit_events` with its own retention. An age-based purge would delete LIVE engagements, which for the partner surface PR 8.4 builds means access disappearing mid-support-case with no revocation anybody performed."
