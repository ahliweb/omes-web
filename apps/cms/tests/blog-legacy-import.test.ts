/**
 * Issue #599 — the bulk import of 23,906 legacy articles, and the redirect map
 * derived from it.
 *
 * ## What is actually at risk
 *
 * Not the arithmetic. Three things, each of which fails silently and is
 * expensive to undo once the archive is in:
 *
 * 1. **`published_at`.** The whole issue is SEO equity. An import that re-dates
 *    every article to the cutover afternoon has moved the archive and thrown
 *    away the thing that made it worth moving — and the row looks completely
 *    normal afterwards.
 * 2. **Silent repair.** The converter rejects `<script>`, `<iframe>` and
 *    unmanaged images. An importer that stored the sanitized remainder would
 *    produce articles that look imported and are missing their pictures.
 * 3. **The second hop.** ADR-0098 made `/blog/{code}/{slug}` locale-prefixed,
 *    so a redirect target built against the pre-ADR shape sends a crawler to a
 *    path that immediately redirects again — the two-hop chain this issue's own
 *    acceptance criterion forbids (PRD §9.2).
 *
 * Pure — no database. The SQL half is exercised in
 * `tests/integration/legacy-import.integration.test.ts`.
