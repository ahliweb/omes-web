/**
 * `/admin/sync` gates against the endpoints it drives, and stays off the ones
 * no browser may legitimately call.
 *
 * Sibling of `admin-data-lifecycle-page-contract.test.ts`,
 * `admin-reporting-page-contract.test.ts`,
 * `admin-approvals-page-contract.test.ts` and
 * `admin-domain-events-page-contract.test.ts`.
 *
 * Three things are specific to this module:
 *
 * - **Resolving a conflict is `conflict_resolution.approve`.**
 *   `conflict_resolution.resolve` and `.update` both read better than the
 *   permission that exists, and neither is seeded, so a page inventing one
 *   would hide every resolution button from every operator including the
 *   owner. This repo has shipped that class of bug twice.
 * - **None of the three mutations takes an `Idempotency-Key`.** All three are
 *   state transitions that are naturally idempotent — `status = 'active'`,
 *   `status = 'resolved'`, `status = 'pending'` — rather than requests that do
 *   fresh work per call. Sending a key would imply a replay contract these
 *   endpoints do not have, and the test asserts the routes still agree.
 * - **`push`/`pull`/`objects`/`status` are the NODE protocol.** They are
 *   authenticated by HMAC signature, not by a session, so a screen offering
 *   buttons for them would render controls no browser can legitimately use.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
