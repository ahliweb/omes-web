/**
 * access-grant-readers-check.ts — `bun run access:grant-readers:check`.
 *
 * Every file that reads a GRANT table by name is on the list below, with the
 * reason it is there. Anything else naming one fails the gate. Pure: source text
 * only, no database, no network.
 *
 * ## What this protects, and why it lands BEFORE the thing it protects
 *
 * Today a grant is `(tenant_user, role)` and answers one question: does this
 * person hold this role, anywhere in the tenant. Gelombang 3 of the membership
 * program (#423) makes a grant carry its own SCOPE, so the same join stops
 * meaning "may act" and starts meaning "may act SOMEWHERE" — and every reader
 * that assembled its own join keeps the old, wider answer while looking
 * untouched. That is not a hypothetical failure mode: it is the same shape as
 * PROJECT_STATE §4 R3, where 31 admin screens decided from raw RBAC and every
 * one of them read as correct.
 *
 * The gate is GREEN today and changes no behaviour. That is the point, and it is
 * why it lands before `awcms_access_policies` rather than beside it: a gate that
 * must be green today is cheapest to add today, and a list written after the
 * risky change is a list written by someone who already has a reason to keep it
 * short. `access:decision-log:coverage:check` (Issue #426) landed on exactly the
 * same argument, one wave earlier.
 *
 * ## Why a file list rather than a call-graph rule
 *
 * The honest signal is "this file names the table". A rule about which module
 * may IMPORT which would miss all of it — every one of these files reaches the
 * table through a SQL template literal, not an import, so the module DAG has
 * nothing to say about them and `modules:table-writes:check` only governs
 * writes. Three of the eleven entries below are outside `identity_access`
 * entirely, and none of them violates a single existing gate.
 *
 * ## Deny-only
 *
 * Nothing here can make an access decision, permit a read, or widen anything.
 * It fails a build or it says nothing.

 * the same reason — a role is a container, not a grant.
