/**
 * `GET`/`POST /api/v1/media/enforcement` (ADR-0036 step 5a) — the managed-media
 * enforcement switch a brochure-site operator previously did not have.
 *
 * The ownership inversion made media independent of `news_portal`, but left the
 * flag (`sql/053`) writable only by `news_portal`'s R2-only preset — which is
 * not ported to this base. A tenant running `blog_content` + `tenant_domain`
 * therefore had the capability and no way to turn it on. This route is that way,
 * and in this base it is the ONLY writer of the flag.
 *
 * ## POST is enable-only, and there is deliberately no DELETE/disable
 *
 * See `enable-managed-media-enforcement.ts`'s header for the full reasoning.
 * Short version: a tenant able to switch its own media validation OFF is the
 * exact exploit `sql/043` documents as confirmed-exploitable in review, so the
 * "off" transition does not exist anywhere in this codebase. Do not add it here.
 *
 * ## Why GET exposes readiness `reasons`
 *
 * So an operator who cannot enable can see WHY (R2 disabled, config incomplete,
 * credentials shared with sync-storage) instead of being told "no". The reasons
 * are deployment-config facts the tenant's own admin already has to act on with
 * their operator; they name variables, never values, so nothing secret leaks.
 * `GET` is still permission-gated (`enforcement.read`) rather than public.
 *
 * ## `POST` requires an `Idempotency-Key`
 *
 * `enforcement.enable` is classified HIGH_RISK (`access-control.ts`
 * `HIGH_RISK_ACTIONS`), and the go-live convention requires idempotency on
 * every high-risk mutation — so this route follows it even though
 * `markManagedMediaEnforced` is itself a monotonic, naturally idempotent upsert
 * (a replay converges on the same state). Only a SUCCESSFUL enable is recorded
 * under the key; a `rejected` (deployment-not-ready) 409 is deliberately NOT
 * persisted, so the same key is free to retry once the R2 config is corrected.
