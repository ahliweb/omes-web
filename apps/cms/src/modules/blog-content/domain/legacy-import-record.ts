/**
 * The input format for `bun run blog:legacy:import` (Issue #599), and the pure
 * validation of one line of it.
 *
 * ## Why NDJSON and not a database link
 *
 * The archive being migrated is somebody else's live MySQL, on somebody else's
 * host, behind somebody else's credentials. A job in this repo that connected to
 * it would put a second database driver, a second set of secrets and a second
 * network dependency into a codebase whose whole runtime is two dependencies.
 * One file, one line per article, produced by whatever can already read that
 * database, keeps the migration's messy half outside the thing being migrated
 * INTO.
 *
 * One line per article also means the reader never holds 23,906 articles in
 * memory, and a malformed line costs one row rather than the run.
 *
 * NOTE ON "23,906": the measured snapshot is 25,029 — see ADR-0114
 * §Consequences, which is the single correction the figure points at. Left
 * standing here because this is an argument about scale, and it does not move.
 *
 * ## Rejection is per-row and reported, never silent
 *
 * FR-DSC of this issue is explicit: the converter must REJECT rather than
 * quietly sanitize. That extends to the record around the body. A line missing a
 * `legacyId` is not importable at all — without it the redirect map cannot be
 * derived, which is the entire point — so it is refused rather than imported
 * under a generated id that would look fine until somebody tried to build the
 * 301s.
