# Changesets

One file per change, written in the same iteration as the change itself. The purpose is simple: when a release is versioned, its notes already exist, written by the person who understood the context best — not reconstructed from `git log` months later.

## When one is required

A change affecting public behaviour, workspace structure, dependencies, or deployment. A typo fix with no change of meaning does not need one.

## Format

File name: `YYYY-MM-DD-summary-in-kebab-case.md`.

```markdown
---
bump: major | minor | patch
type: content | structure | fix | dependency | docs
impact: public | internal
---

# A short title

What changed and **why**. The "why" is the valuable half —
the "what" can be read from the diff, the "why" cannot.

- A point of change a reader or operator would notice.
- A point of change only felt while developing.
```

## `bump` decides the version

This is the field the release reads. The next version is the **largest** `bump` among the waiting changesets: one `minor` beside nine `patch` entries makes the whole release `minor`.

| `bump` | In this repo, that means | Example |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| `major` | a public contract breaks — a published package's exported shape, a workspace's public API, a documented CLI flag | a gate's exit-code contract changes |
| `minor` | something is gained: a new gate, a new script, a new workspace, a new capability | `packages/kontrak` lands |
| `patch` | a fix that does not change the shape of anything | a typo, a dependency bump, a corrected gate message |

Choose it **while writing the change**, which is the only moment anyone reliably knows the answer. A level decided later, by whoever happens to run the release script, is a level decided from a list of file names rather than from the change itself — precisely the failure this convention exists to avoid.

Two rules follow from `bump` being load-bearing, both enforced by `tests/versi-changeset.test.mjs`:

- **A changeset without a valid `bump` fails the gate.** Not because the field is paperwork, but because the failure it prevents is invisible: a changeset the release cannot read stops contributing to the version and nothing looks wrong.
- **`bun run release` may be told a level, and it may only be a LARGER one.** A releaser who knows the change is bigger than its changesets admit may say so; a smaller one is refused, because it would publish a break behind a number promising there is none.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, tagged `vX.Y.Z`. This repo is still `0.x`, where semver itself makes no compatibility promise — `bump` records intent now so the record is already true when `1.0.0` makes it binding.

## The backlog has two bounds

`bump` decides how big a release is; it never decides **when**. `bun run audit:rilis` bounds the waiting backlog in this directory and runs in CI beside the other gates:

| Bound | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Files waiting | **20** |
| Age of the oldest | **14 days** |

The count was 10 until increment 3 (PR #76): one increment accumulated eighteen changesets before its own release, so 10 reddened every PR in the second half with nothing for the contributor to do about it. 20 is the measured size of one increment's release plus headroom — still low enough that a backlog nobody is releasing gets noticed. The age bound stays at 14 days; it is the age, not the count, that catches an unwatched backlog (see `packages/gerbang/audit-rilis.mjs`'s own docblock).

The file name is what carries the age, so `YYYY-MM-DD-` is **required rather than merely documented**: a name the gate cannot date never ages, and it would sit here invisible to the one check built to see it. A date the calendar does not have (`2026-02-31`) is refused, and so is one more than a day ahead of the machine checking it — one day of slack, because the author names the file in their own timezone and CI keeps UTC.

Crossing a bound is not a fault to apologise for — it is the signal that `bun run release --apply` is due. The release script does not run this gate, because folding the changesets is exactly what clears it.

## Notes

Files here are folded into [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) by `bun run release`, then deleted. Their titles are demoted two levels so they nest neatly under the version heading.

**Relative links are written from the point of view of `.changesets/`.** The release script rewrites those paths to the repo root's point of view as it folds them — `../docs/x.md` becomes `docs/x.md`. `bun run audit:dokumen` resolves every link from the location of the file that contains it, so that same rule is checked with no special case for this directory.

Changesets themselves are **not** mirrored into Indonesian, unlike the rest of the documents here: they are ephemeral by construction — folded into the changelog and deleted on release — so a mirror would outlive its source by exactly one release. This README is a document like any other, and is mirrored.
