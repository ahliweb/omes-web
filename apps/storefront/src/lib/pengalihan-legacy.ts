/**
 * Legacy URL → `/berita/{slug}` (or `/video/{slug}`, for a video post — see
 * `buildLegacyRedirectMap`'s own docblock) redirect map (issue #28) — turns
 * `awcms_seo_redirects` rows with `origin: "legacy_blog"`
 * (`src/lib/awcms/blog.ts`'s `getLegacyRedirectRows()`) into a static
 * `sourcePath -> targetPath` map, baked into the build by
 * `src/profil/berita/pages/index/pengalihan-legacy.json.ts` and read once, at startup, by
 * `server/penyaji.mjs`'s additive redirect hook — never at request time, so
 * a finished build still never contacts awcms again.
 *
 * ## Why the CMS's own `target` column is not used verbatim
 *
 * `target` (verified against `redirect-directory.ts`'s `RedirectRecord`) is
 * whatever path the CMS's own operator/import tooling recorded as the
 * eventual destination for a `relative_same_tenant` rule — most plausibly
 * this CMS's OWN themed `/blog/{tenantCode}/{slug}` page (ADR-0071's
 * permanent vocabulary for `apps/cms` itself), which has no reason to know
 * this storefront's `/berita/{slug}` (or `/video/{slug}`) shape exists. The
 * one fact both sides agree on is the post's SLUG, not the path shape
 * around it — so this file reads only the trailing path segment of `target`
 * and rebuilds the destination in this app's own URL vocabulary
 * (`ROUTES.article`/`ROUTES.videoArticle`).
 *
 * `verified_external` rows are skipped outright: they point somewhere this
 * storefront does not serve, and sending a reader through this app to an
 * outside URL is not this hook's job.

/**
 * Normalizes a stored/incoming source path the same way on both sides of
 * the comparison — decode, strip query/fragment, drop one trailing slash —
 * so `/News/1-x.html` and an incoming `/News/1-x.html?utm=fb` (or a stored
 * `/2024/01/02/judul/` and an incoming request with no trailing slash
 * mismatch) still compare equal. An undecodable path is left as-is rather
 * than thrown on — it simply will not match anything real, which is the
 * correct outcome for a malformed URL nobody could have followed anyway.
 *
 * ONE shape is exempt from the query strip: `/video/?video={id}-…` carries
 * its whole identity in the query — unlike `?utm=fb` on an otherwise-
 * complete path, there is no path left once it is removed. Stripping it
 * here would collapse every such row onto the identical bare `/video` key,
 * which `buildLegacyRedirectMap`'s own conflict guard would then reject the
 * moment a second, differently-targeted video row exists.
 *
 * That exemption is defensive, NOT the contract. The CMS itself can never
 * STORE that form: `validateRedirectInput` runs every redirect source
 * through `normalizeRedirectPath` WITHOUT `keepQuery` (`apps/cms/src/
 * modules/seo-distribution/domain/redirect-rule.ts`, `redirect-path.ts` —
 * checked directly), so a `/video/?video=…` source posted to the import
 * route is written as `/video`, and `GET /api/v1/seo/redirects` can never
 * hand this function the query-carrying form. The real contract (issue #58
 * review round 2) is therefore the QUERY-FREE synthetic key the exporter
 * writes instead — `/video/{id}-{slug}.html` (`videoRedirectSourcePath` in
 * `tools/import-seputarborneo.ts`), a path that never existed publicly and
 * passes through this function like any other. `apps/storefront/server/
 * pengalihan-aturan.mjs`'s `rowIdIndexFor` (issue #55/A9) indexes BOTH
 * shapes by their numeric id, and answers the real inbound `/video/?video=
 * {id}-…` request from that index. The branch below stays only so a row
 * that reaches this map some other way (a hand-authored fixture, a future
 * CMS that keeps the query) is not silently destroyed.
