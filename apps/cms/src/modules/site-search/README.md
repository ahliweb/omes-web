# site_search

Tenant-scoped, cross-content **PostgreSQL full-text search** over PUBLISHED website content ([ADR-0040](../../../docs/adr/0040-site-search-module-admission.md), ported from awcms-micro Issue #270 / ADR-0031). Official Optional Module, `type: "domain"`, depends only on Core (`tenant_admin`, `identity_access`).

## What it owns

- The unified search index `awcms_site_search_documents` (sql/064, RLS FORCE'd) — a `tsvector`/GIN projection of every content module's currently-public rows, plus a `pg_trgm` GIN index on `title` for suggestions.
- Per-tenant config (`awcms_site_search_settings`), the index run ledger (`awcms_site_search_index_runs`), failed-item diagnostics (`awcms_site_search_index_failures`), and an opt-in minimized query log (`awcms_site_search_query_log`).
- The public `/search` page + JSON `/api/v1/site-search/{query,suggest}`, and the admin API `/api/v1/site-search/{settings,index/*}`.

## Contribution seam — `SearchSourceDescriptor` (ADR-0040 §3)

Content modules declare **pure-data** `SearchSourceDescriptor`s in their own `module.ts` via `ModuleDescriptor.searchSources` (see `blog_content`'s `blog_content.post` descriptor). A descriptor maps a source table's columns (title/summary/body/tags/locale/slug/updated_at) + a **declarative publication filter** (equals / notNull / isNull / timeReached) + a URL template + a relevance weight. There is **no executable extractor and no tenant SQL** — the generic engine (`application/search-index-engine.ts`) builds a parameterized query from the descriptor; only reviewed IDENTIFIERS (validated against `^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$` / `awcms_`) are interpolated, exactly like `data_lifecycle`'s generic executionMode.

`domain/search-source-registry.ts` aggregates + validates every module's descriptors through `listModules()` (the `reporting`/`data_lifecycle` precedent), gated in CI by `bun run site-search:sources:check`. It is NOT modeled as a `search_source` capability `provides` — >1 provider would trip `capability_provider_conflict`.

## Indexing (ADR-0040 §4)

- **reconcile** (deterministic, idempotent): upsert the current public set (checksum-gated skip) + delete stale index documents (source row gone or no longer public). Re-running while in sync is a no-op; matches source counts/checksums.
- **rebuild** (idempotent): delete the tenant's documents for the given sources, then reconcile — end state identical regardless of prior state.
- **reindex** (`reindexSearchResource`): re-extract one resource; public → upsert, no longer public → remove. The event-shaped incremental primitive.
- **Job:** `bun run site-search:reconcile` (scheduled backbone; `--rebuild`, `--tenant=<id>`). Because `blog_content` publishes lifecycle as log lines (not real outbox events), this scheduled sweep is the deterministic backbone; the reindex primitive + a future domain-event consumer are the low-latency path once a content module emits real lifecycle events.

## Security spine

- **Publication-state** enforced at the source→index boundary — the index holds public content only and is NEVER an authorization source.
- **Tenant + locale isolation** — RLS FORCE + explicit `tenant_id`/`locale` predicates; `buildSearchCacheKey` refuses a key without tenant/locale/query-hash (cache-poisoning / cross-tenant defense).
- **SQL injection** — the query is always a bound parameter into `websearch_to_tsquery('simple', $1)`; descriptor identifiers are validated before interpolation.
- **XSS** — snippets are built by `ts_headline` with non-HTML sentinels, escaped in `renderSafeSnippet`, then the sentinels become `<mark>` — content-originated markup can never survive.
- **Anonymous abuse** — per-IP rate limits, query-length bounds, result caps.
- **Public URL safety** — `:tenantCode`/`:slug`/`:id` are `encodeURIComponent`'d at index time, so no source value can inject a path segment or a scheme.

## AWCMS port adaptations (vs. awcms-micro)

| Area                   | awcms-micro                     | Here                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public content URL     | host-resolved `/news/:slug`     | path-tenant-scoped `/blog/:tenantCode/:slug` (ADR-0009) — the descriptor gains a `:tenantCode` placeholder the engine resolves once per run from `awcms_tenants.tenant_code`                                            |
| `/search` typeahead    | inline `<script>` ARIA combobox | **not ported** — this base's CSP has no `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts and public pages are plain APIRoute HTML with no bundling step. The page ships no-JS core search; `/suggest` stays available for a theme's client |
| Page labels            | gettext `createTranslator`      | `DEFAULT_SEARCH_PAGE_LABELS` (this base has no i18n catalog runtime) — kept a parameter so adding one later is a caller change                                                                                          |
| `reconcile` permission | existing `AccessAction`         | added to the union here (explicitly NOT high-risk; still idempotency-keyed + audited)                                                                                                                                   |
| Registry gate          | unit test only                  | additionally `bun run site-search:sources:check` in the `check` chain (this base's convention for every descriptor registry)                                                                                            |

## Follow-up (documented, not silently dropped)

Blog PAGES (no public route in this base) and other resource types, media/gallery metadata, per-document `domain_event_runtime` events, an admin dashboard UI, and a bundled typeahead client for `/search`. The descriptor seam already supports the additional sources.
