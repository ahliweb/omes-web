/**
 * `listDueScheduledExports` against a real PostgreSQL.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `reporting:exports:dispatch` failed on EVERY tick with
 *
 *     PostgresError: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone > interval
 *
 * The statement binds `now` as a parameter and subtracts an interval from it:
 *
 *     er.created_at > ${now} - make_interval(mins => se.schedule_interval_minutes)
 *
 * The parameter arrives untyped, and the only clue Postgres has for inferring it
 * is the `- make_interval(...)` beside it, which resolves to `interval - interval`.
 * The expression is then an `interval`, and `timestamptz > interval` has no
 * operator, so the statement THROWS rather than returning a wrong answer.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * Three things had to be true at once, and they were:
 *
 * 1. The job was never scheduled — `crontab -l` carried one of 32 — so the
 *    statement had never executed anywhere.
 * 2. `--dry-run` reported `status: success`, because it never reaches this path.
 *    A dry-run is not a run.
 * 3. No test called this function. Every other test in `reporting` uses the
 *    projection tables, not the scheduled-export ones.
 *
 * It was found by putting the job on a real schedule and reading the log fifteen
 * minutes later.
 *
 * ## Why an INTEGRATION test, and not a unit test asserting the SQL text
 *
 * The defect is Postgres's parameter-type inference. A unit test that asserts
 * the query string contains `::timestamptz` would pass on any string containing
 * those characters and would keep passing if the cast moved somewhere useless —
 * it checks the shape, and the shape was never the problem. Only a real planner
 * can answer whether this statement is executable. So this calls the function.
 *
 * Skipped entirely unless `DATABASE_URL` is set (see harness.ts §Gating).
