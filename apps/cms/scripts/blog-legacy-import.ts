/**
 * blog-legacy-import.ts — `bun run blog:legacy:import`.
 *
 * Issue #599, the deliverable the first design pass forgot: **something that
 * actually writes `legacy_source_id`**. `sql/138` added the column and
 * `listLegacyRedirectMappings` reads it, but nothing filled it, so the redirect
 * map had a reader and no writer.
 *
 * ## Preview is the default, `--commit` is a second deliberate act
 *
 * Same inversion as `blog:ads:ingest`, for the same reason and more of it: this
 * is run once, by hand, against a live newsroom's entire archive, by an operator
 * who is about to point 23,906 indexed URLs at it. The expensive mistake is not
 * "forgot to preview" — it is "previewed, then never read the rejections". The
 * report is therefore what you get unless you say otherwise, and the run that
 * writes has to be typed on purpose.
 *
 * NOTE ON "23,906": the measured snapshot is 25,029 — see ADR-0114
 * §Consequences, which is the single correction the figure points at. Left
 * standing here because this is an argument about scale, and it does not move.
 *
 * ## Input
 *
 * NDJSON on a path given by `--file=<path>`, one article per line. See
 * `blog-content/domain/legacy-import-record.ts` for the field list and for why
 * the format is a file rather than a connection to the legacy database.
 *
 *   {"legacyId":"48213","title":"...","slug":"banjir-kobar","bodyHtml":"<p>…",
 *    "publishedAt":"2019-03-04T02:11:00Z","status":"published"}
 *
 * ## What gets refused, and why refusal is the feature
 *
 * Five independent gates, all reported per row, none of which silently repairs
 * anything:
 *
 * 1. **The record** — a line with no `legacyId` cannot be part of a redirect
 *    map and is refused rather than imported under a generated one; a
 *    `published` row with no `publishedAt` is refused rather than re-dated to
 *    the cutover afternoon. A `legacyId` or a `slug` appearing TWICE in one
 *    file is the export script's bug and is refused on its second occurrence.
 * 2. **The body** — `convertLegacyHtmlToPortableText` rejects `<script>`,
 *    `<iframe>`, event handlers, `javascript:` hrefs and unmanaged `<img>`
 *    sources. This job does NOT import the sanitized remainder: a body whose
 *    images were dropped is a broken article that looks imported, and finding
 *    that out from a report beats finding it out from a reader.
 * 3. **The lead photograph** — a `featuredImageSrc` the `--media-map` does not
 *    cover is refused for the same reason as an unmanaged `<img>`: an article
 *    that imported cleanly and lost the picture the legacy page led with looks
 *    like a success.
 * 4. **The slug** — checked against what this tenant already has, up front and
 *    in one query, so a collision is a line in the report rather than a
 *    constraint error 12,000 rows into a run.
 * 5. **The section** — and only once `--section-map` is supplied. See below;
 *    it is the one gate whose absence is a WARNING rather than a refusal.
 *
 * ## The images, and the two flags that make the archive importable at all
 *
 * Gate 2 refuses a raw `<img>`, because a managed-media deployment stores images
 * as registry references and nothing here can turn a legacy URL into one.
 *
 * This paragraph used to say that in practice EVERY row of a real CKEditor
 * archive was residue. **Measured, it is 4 of 25,029 — 0.02%** — and only 2
 * bodies contain an `<img>` at all. The handoff below is still the right shape;
 * what was wrong was the scale it implied. The real media task is the LEAD
 * photograph, which lives in the `foto_berita` column and not in the body: all
 * 25,029 articles have one, and body scanning never mentioned them (see
 * ADR-0114 and the ORIGIN ROUND in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` §4). That gap is now
 * closed — the record carries `featuredImageSrc`, `--images` reports it beside
 * the body images with the two counted separately, and a mapped one is written
 * to `awcms_blog_posts.featured_media_id`, the column `sql/035:46` has had
 * since the schema was created and `public-content-port-adapter.ts` has been
 * serving to `awcms-astro` all along.
 *
 * It is still not a gap to close by fetching the file — see
 * `legacy-media-map.ts` and `legacy-ad-ingest.ts` for why the server must not.
 * It is a handoff, and it has both halves:
 *
 *   `--images=<path>`     writes the upload set — every distinct `src` the
 *                         archive still needs uploaded, body images and lead
 *                         photographs alike, most-used first — and stops.
 *                         Upload those through `/admin/media`.
 *   `--media-map=<path>`  takes the result back as `{ "<src>": "<uuid>" }`.
 *                         ONE map for both kinds. Every id in it is checked
 *                         against THIS tenant's registry before a single
 *                         article is converted, and one that is not verified
 *                         media aborts the run — an unresolvable media
 *                         reference renders as nothing, so importing past it
 *                         would produce articles that look fine and have lost
 *                         their photographs.
 *
 * A mapped body image becomes a one-item `gallery` node in the position it
 * occupied in the article; a mapped lead photograph becomes
 * `featured_media_id`; an unmapped one of either kind is refused.
 *
 * ## The categories, and why they are the same handoff again
 *
 * `LegacyPostImportInput` carried no taxonomy and this job wrote no join row,
 * so a real import landed every article with ZERO categories. The redirect map
 * would then have pointed the legacy rubrik URLs at
 * `/{locale}/kategori/{slug}` pages that resolve, load, and list nothing — a
 * SOFT 404, which is worse for the ranking than the hard 404 this issue exists
 * to prevent, because nothing reports it.
 *
 *   `--terms=<path>`      writes the category work list (every legacy category
 *                         the archive files under, most-used first) and stops.
 *                         Create the terms you want in `/admin/blog-taxonomy`.
 *   `--term-map=<path>`   takes the result back as `{ "<name>": "<term uuid>" }`.
 *                         Every id is checked against this tenant's LIVE
 *                         taxonomy before a single article is written, and one
 *                         that is not aborts the run.
 *
 * Names are never created from a row. An importer that creates a term because
 * an export mentioned one turns a single typo into a published category nobody
 * chose, with no review step where anyone would notice; a newsroom's taxonomy
 * is an editorial decision, not a side effect of an import. A row naming a
 * category the map does not cover is refused, for the same reason a row with an
 * unmanaged `<img>` is: an article that imported cleanly and lost its filing
 * looks like a success.
 *
 * ## The sections, and why they are NOT the categories again (ADR-0115)
 *
 * `content_json` was written as a hard-coded `{ blocks: [] }`, and that one
 * literal decided two things in `ahliweb/awcms-astro`, the repo that renders
 * this archive. Measured against that repo's real adapter rather than argued:
 * a post carrying the sidecar builds **1** article; a post written the way this
 * importer wrote it builds **0**, in every configured tab — no article page,
 * and no category archive either, because those are assembled from the same
 * tab-filtered set. So ADR-0113's 63 rubrik rules and ADR-0114's id-keyed
 * article map would BOTH have redirected onto pages that were never generated.
 *
 * Two halves fix it, and they are independent:
 *
 *  - `blocks` is now the DERIVED projection (`withProjectedBlocks`, the same
 *    call `blog-post-directory.ts` makes) rather than an empty array, so a body
 *    renders. That needs no flag and applies to every run.
 *  - `content_json.awcmsAstro.kategori` carries the SECTION, and that needs one:
 *
 *   `--section-map=<path>` JSON `{ "<legacy category name>": "<section slug>" }`.
 *                         The same work list `--terms` already writes, with a
 *                         different right-hand column.
 *
 * **Why a third map instead of deriving it from `--term-map`.** A term is a row
 * in THIS database; a section is a tab slug in the consuming repo's
 * `siteConfig.tabs`. Different vocabularies, in different repositories, and
 * nothing here can read that file — so the section map is the ONE map with no
 * verification sweep behind it, and the run PRINTS the vocabulary it was handed
 * instead of pretending to check it.
 *
 * **Why a missing map warns rather than refuses.** A tenant served by this repo
 * at `/blog/{tenantCode}/{slug}` needs no sidecar at all, and refusing 25,029
 * rows over a repository the operator may not be using would be the wrong
 * failure. A row that names no section under a map that WAS supplied is refused,
 * because supplying one is the declaration that the sibling site serves this.
 *
 * ## Roles and transactions
 *
 * Runs as the APP role, not `awcms_worker`. This creates content, which is an
 * authoring action; giving the worker INSERT on `awcms_blog_posts` so a one-shot
 * operator script could use it would widen a scheduled role's reach permanently
 * for a job that runs once. RLS is FORCE'd either way, so every batch is inside
 * `withTenantOrThrow`.
 *
 * Batched: each batch is one transaction, so an interrupted run leaves whole
 * batches rather than half an article, and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes the
 * re-run skip what landed.
 *
 * Not a `runJob` worker — no advisory lock, no `JobResult`. Run one at a time.

 * The whole per-row decision, with no database in it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function and not just the middle of `main`
 *
 * It used to be the middle of `main`, and the only way to observe what it
 * decided was to run the CLI against a live Postgres. That made the DB-free
 * test for the in-file slug guard a SOURCE-TEXT test — it asserted that the
 * identifier `seenSlugs` appeared, and appeared before
 * `categoriesPerArticle.push`. Delete only the `continue;` from the collision
 * branch and every one of those assertions still held: the Map was still
 * there, the refusal was still pushed, the ordering was still right, and the
 * second colliding row sailed on into `accepted` to raise 23505 mid-batch —
 * after earlier batches had already committed. `DATABASE_URL="" bun run check`
 * was green on a dedupe that did not dedupe.
 *
 * Everything this needs is already RESOLVED before the first line is read: the
 * media map has been verified against this tenant's registry and the term map
 * against its taxonomy, both by `main`, both before any row is parsed. So the
 * row decisions need no connection, and pulling them out makes the refusals
 * and the accepted set ordinary return values that a test can read.
 *
 * `main` keeps what genuinely needs the database: the two verification sweeps
 * above it, the one `findTakenSlugs` query below it, and the batched write.

    // script's CLI tests assert `stderr === ""` on a run that exits 0 — the
    // contract is "stderr means the run FAILED", stated in their own comment as
    // "a refusal is not a failure of the run". A warning on stderr makes
    // `stderr === ""` stop meaning "clean", which is a signal a shell can act
    // on and this would have quietly taken away. It goes on stdout, with the
    // rest of the report it belongs to.
