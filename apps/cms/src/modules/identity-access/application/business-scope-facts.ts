/**
 * Resolves the bounded, I/O-derived business-scope facts
 * `domain/access-control.ts`'s `evaluateAccess` needs to stay pure (Issue
 * #180, epic #177 Wave 2 authorization). Ported from awcms-mini
 * (`identity-access/application/business-scope-facts.ts`, Issue #746),
 * REDUCED to the generic scope-fact resolver only.
 *
 * `resolveBusinessScopeFacts` returns the `(scopeType, scopeId)` scopes the
 * subject currently holds ANY active assignment for (regardless of
 * role/permission), each ENRICHED with the hierarchy resolution from the
 * injected `BusinessScopeHierarchyPort` (ancestors/descendants for
 * descendant/ancestor coverage; `resolved` for the fail-closed high-risk
 * gate). These feed `evaluateAccess`'s optional `businessScopeFacts`
 * parameter (a route opts a request in via
 * `resourceAttributes.requiredScopeType`/`.requiredScopeId`).
 *
 * SoD facts (#181, filled from mini): this file ALSO exports the
 * permission-keyed facts that segregation-of-duties conflict detection
 * consumes — `resolveSoDAssignmentFacts` (merging BOTH the
 * business-scope-assignment path AND the ordinary RBAC role-grant path, see
 * `resolveOrdinaryRbacFacts`'s own header) and `resolveRolePermissionKeys`
 * (the keys a role would newly confer at assignment-create time). These feed
 * `domain/sod-conflict-evaluation.ts` (the pure matcher) via the
 * assignment-service SEAM and the `high-risk-sod-guard` chokepoint. #180
 * shipped only the generic scope resolver above; #181 adds these below without
 * changing anything above.

 * - WALL-CLOCK TIMEOUT (`AUTH_BUSINESS_SCOPE_HIERARCHY_TIMEOUT_MS`, default
 *   500ms): if the adapter does not resolve in time, the scope is treated as
 *   `resolved: false` (deny hierarchy coverage), NEVER as coverage. **Honest
 *   limit (ADR-0030):** this only bounds an adapter that AWAITS I/O (e.g. a
 *   SQL query — which Postgres `statement_timeout` independently caps). A
 *   purely-SYNCHRONOUS CPU infinite loop inside the adapter cannot be
 *   interrupted from JavaScript — the event loop never regains control, so the
 *   timer never fires, and the `resolveScope()` call itself blocks before this
 *   race is even set up. That case remains the contributing domain module's
 *   own responsibility (`src/modules/`; ADR-0034 removed the derived-app
 *   pathway).
 * - COMBINED-LENGTH CAP (`AUTH_BUSINESS_SCOPE_HIERARCHY_MAX_RELATED_SCOPES`,
 *   default 5000): if `ancestorScopes.length + descendantScopes.length`
 *   exceeds the bound, the scope is treated as `resolved: false` — a runaway
 *   adapter cannot flood the evaluator's per-fact coverage scan.
