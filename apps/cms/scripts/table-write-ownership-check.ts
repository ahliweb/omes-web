/**
 * `bun run modules:table-writes:check` — ADR-0013 §6, "no shared-table write".
 *
 * Every `awcms_*` table is written by at most ONE module, or the sharing is in
 * the reviewed exception list below.
 *
 * ## The rule was cited but never enforced
 *
 * `_shared/module-contract.ts` invokes "ADR-0013 §6 no shared-table write" FOUR
 * separate times — in the docs for `dataLifecycle`, `searchSources`,
 * `commentableResources`, and `reportingProjections` — as the reason each of
 * those seams passes DECLARATIVE metadata to a central engine instead of
 * letting one module reach into another's schema. Each of those seams honours
 * it. Nothing checked the hand-written SQL everywhere else, and six tables were
 * being written by more than one module when this landed.
 *
 * The concrete cost was already visible in the smallest possible form:
 * `identity_access` had two independent `INSERT INTO awcms_profiles` sites
 * (JIT provisioning #185 and self-registration approval #276) that had drifted
 * apart on `verification_status`, so two accounts created minutes apart got
 * different verification postures for reasons nobody had decided. Both now go
 * through `profile_identity`'s own `createPersonProfileForIdentity`.
 *
 * ## Ownership is derived, not declared
 *
 * There is no `tables:` field in `ModuleDescriptor` and this gate deliberately
 * does not add one. The rule is "at most one writer", which is a property of
 * the code as written — so the writers ARE the evidence, and a new table needs
 * no registration to be covered. That also means the gate cannot go stale in
 * the dangerous direction: a table nobody registered is not a table nobody
 * checks.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot see (stated, not silently dropped)
 *
 * It matches LITERAL table names in `INSERT INTO` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE FROM`.
 * It therefore does NOT see `data_lifecycle`'s bounded purge or `reporting`'s
 * projection workers, which write `${tableName}` interpolated from a
 * descriptor. That is the correct blind spot rather than a gap: those engines
 * touch only what the OWNING module declared, which is the very mechanism
 * ADR-0013 §6 prescribes, and `data-lifecycle:registry:check` /
 * `reporting:projections:registry:check` already gate the declarations. What is
 * left over — a hand-written INSERT naming another module's table — is exactly
 * the undeclared coupling this exists to catch.
 *
 * Pure: reads `listModules()` and the source tree. No database, no network.
