/**
 * Retry classification (Issue #697, epic #679, platform-hardening — shared
 * worker runner). Standardizes which caught errors are safe to retry — on
 * the next scheduled run, since this runner does not implement its own
 * in-process retry/backoff loop (that would start turning this "small
 * shared runner" into a job-queue system, which the issue explicitly rules
 * out) — versus which represent a caller/data problem that will fail again
 * identically no matter how many times it runs.
 *
 * Reuses, rather than re-derives, the exact SQLSTATE-class split
 * `src/lib/database/tenant-context.ts`'s `isPostgresClientInputError`
 * already established for the same underlying question ("is this a
 * database/infra failure, or bad caller input?"):
 *
 * - Class `22` (data exception) and `23` (integrity constraint violation)
 *   are NOT_RETRYABLE here too — a unique-violation or an invalid-input
 *   value will fail the exact same way on a retry.
 *
 * Adds the two SQLSTATE codes PostgreSQL's own documentation names as
 * expected-and-safe-to-retry ("Serialization Failure Handling",
 * postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-serialization-failure-handling.html):
 * `40001` (serialization_failure, under `SERIALIZABLE`) and `40P01`
 * (deadlock_detected) — both are the database asking the client to just
 * try the whole transaction again. Also treats connection-level exceptions
 * (class `08`), insufficient-resources (class `53`), and operator
 * intervention (class `57`, e.g. `57P03` cannot_connect_now during a
 * restart) as retryable — transient infra conditions, not data problems.
 *
 * `DatabaseBusyError` is imported rather than duplicated, unlike the SQLSTATE
 * lists above: it is an exported type with one construction site, so there is
 * no internal detail to leak and nothing that could drift out of step.
