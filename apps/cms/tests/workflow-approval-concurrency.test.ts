/**
 * Real-PostgreSQL concurrency tests for workflow approval (Issue #140, Issue
 * #152, GHSA-9qwq-cmr5-6wfc). These CANNOT be written against a fake `Bun.SQL`:
 * every bug under test is a property of PostgreSQL's READ COMMITTED snapshot
 * and row-locking semantics, so a stubbed driver would prove nothing.
 *
 * Requires a throwaway database whose schema has had `sql/` applied
 * (`bun run db:migrate`). Gated on `DATABASE_URL` — the same convention
 * `reporting-projection-rebuild-lock.test.ts` uses. `ci.yml`'s `quality` job
 * has no database and skips cleanly; this actually executes in `ci.yml`'s
 * `integration-tests` job and `release.yml`'s `validate` job, each in a
 * dedicated `bun test <legacy files>` step run separately from the
 * harness-based `tests/integration/` suite (see `tests/integration/
 * harness.ts` — the two collide if run together in one `bun test` process).
 * Gating on a bespoke variable instead would mean these tests never run in
 * any pipeline. `WORKFLOW_TEST_DATABASE_URL` still overrides it for a local
 * run against a scratch database.
 *
 * The suite only ever touches tenants it creates itself, and deletes them
 * again afterwards.
