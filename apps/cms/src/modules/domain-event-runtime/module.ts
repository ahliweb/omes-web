  description:
    "Transactional, versioned domain-event outbox and dispatcher. Provider-neutral, generic multi-consumer infrastructure — one event can fan out to MANY registered consumers, with explicit per-aggregate/order-key ordering (never a global total order). Producers call `application/append-domain-event.ts`'s `appendDomainEvent` inside their OWN business transaction (same-commit outbox write, ADR-0006 compliant: no external call happens there). A static, reviewed-source-code consumer registry (`infrastructure/consumer-registry.ts`) decides fan-out at publish time; `application/dispatch-domain-events.ts` (`bun run domain-events:dispatch`, built on the shared worker runner `src/lib/jobs/job-runner.ts`) claims/executes/finalizes deliveries with per-order-key ordering, exponential backoff, and dead-letter handling. Dead-lettered deliveries can be replayed by a permission-gated, reason-required, audited, idempotent admin action (`application/delivery-replay.ts`). Ships exactly one self-contained reference event type (`sample.recorded`, `domain/event-type-registry.ts`) and two representative consumers (a same-process cross-module audit projector, and a self-contained reporting/read-model activity-rollup projection) to exercise the full mechanism end-to-end — real producer/consumer wiring for domain modules is intentionally deferred to follow-up work. An optional broker adapter port (`infrastructure/broker-adapter-port.ts`) is defined for future out-of-process delivery; no external broker is required or registered by default — PostgreSQL/in-process dispatch is the only implemented path, so offline/LAN deployments are unaffected. Ported from awcms-mini's proven `domain-event-runtime` module. See `README.md` for full design rationale.",

  /**
   * Issue #468, ADR-0072. ONE descriptor for a module with six tables on
   * `TABLES_PREDATING_THE_RULE`, and the five that stay are a scope statement
   * rather than an oversight.
   *
   * `awcms_domain_events` — the parent, holding the payloads — is the larger
   * half of the disk problem and deliberately out of scope. Deleting deliveries
   * does not shrink it, and how long an event PAYLOAD is worth keeping is a
   * different question from how long a delivery RECEIPT is: the first is a
   * business record other things replay from, the second is transport
   * bookkeeping. Claiming both in one PR would answer the easy one and bury the
   * hard one.
   *
   * ## `dead_letter` is excluded, and it is the trap
   *
   * It LOOKS terminal — the dispatcher will never retry one on its own — and it
   * is precisely the row an operator opens the console to find and replay. A
   * window that swept it would delete the work AND its evidence, and the
   * deletion would be indistinguishable from the queue having drained cleanly.
