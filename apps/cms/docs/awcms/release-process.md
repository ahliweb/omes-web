# Release Process — Changesets, SBOM, Signing, Provenance

> **Document status:** the pipeline **has already been executed as a real release**. The first real release **`v6.0.0` (2026-07-21)** ran `.github/workflows/release.yml` end-to-end via a `v6.0.0` tag push: `validate` → `build` (image + two SBOMs) → `sign-attest-publish` all succeeded, image `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:6.0.0` (+`:latest`,`:sha-*`) was published with a verified attestation (`gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:6.0.0 --owner ahliweb` → OK), and GitHub Release `v6.0.0` shipped with SBOM×2 + `CHECKSUMS.txt` + `source.tar.gz` assets. The previous version `5.0.0` was a manual jump continuing the legacy major line `v4.6.0` (see [ADR-0024](../adr/0024-semver-numbering-continues-legacy-major-line.md)); `6.0.0` is a normal changeset bump (MAJOR: breaking ADR-0034). Both workflows (`.github/workflows/changesets.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `Dockerfile.production`, `scripts/release-verify.ts`) were adapted from the `awcms-mini` base.
>
> **✅ The approval gate is now ACTIVE (configured 2026-07-21).** On release `v6.0.0` the `sign-attest-publish` job ran **without any "Waiting for review" pause** because the `release` Environment had no required reviewers yet. That gap is **now closed**: required reviewer `ahliweb` (id `44542506`) was installed via `gh api -X PUT .../environments/release` (`prevent_self_review: false`, `can_admins_bypass: true`). **Verified through a rehearsal** (`workflow_dispatch`, run 29831369872): `validate`+`build` succeeded and then `sign-attest-publish` stopped at `status: waiting` with a pending deployment for environment `release` — proving the gate really does hold (the rehearsal run was then cancelled without publishing). From now on every real release **and** rehearsal pauses waiting for a maintainer's **Approve and deploy** before sign/attest/publish.
>
> **Tag procedure (correction):** there is no `bun run changeset:tag` script — the release tag `vX.Y.Z` is created **manually** (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"` → `RELEASE_VERIFY_TAG=vX.Y.Z bun run release:verify` → `git push origin vX.Y.Z`). The image is tagged **without** the `v` prefix (`6.0.0`), while the git tag and GitHub Release use `v6.0.0`.

Changesets already manages the version bump and `CHANGELOG.md` (see `.changeset/` and `CHANGELOG.md` in this repo plus `docs/awcms/09_roadmap_repository_commit.md` §Versioning with Changesets, to follow) and `bun run changesets:policy:check` already enforces the changeset policy on every PR (`.github/workflows/changesets.yml`). `release.yml` produces an image, two SBOMs, a signature, and provenance that can be verified — its design is documented in full below, its implementation lives in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

Both triggers must run exactly the same `validate` job — the rehearsal path is not a shortcut around the quality gate, it only skips the tag-ancestor guard and `release:verify` (both `if: github.event_name == 'push'`; `bun run check` itself always runs).

## 0. The version model: `vX.Y.Z`

One version number, three places, three spellings — and only one of them carries the `v`:

| Where                    | Spelling | Example                       |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `package.json`           | `X.Y.Z`  | `9.1.2`                       |
| git tag / GitHub Release | `vX.Y.Z` | `v9.1.2`                      |
| container image tag      | `X.Y.Z`  | `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:9.1.2` |

`release.yml` derives the image tag by stripping the prefix (`VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"`), so `…:v9.1.2` does not exist in the registry — see §Verification for the `manifest unknown` this produces if the `v` is written along with it. `scripts/lib/semver.ts` owns all three spellings; `releaseTagFor()` is the only place the `v` is added.

**Release versions only.** `X.Y.Z` means exactly three numeric fields: no prerelease suffix (`-rc.1`), no build metadata (`+build.5`), no leading zeros. This is stricter than SemVer allows, deliberately. `release.yml`'s tag trigger is the glob `v*.*.*`, and a glob cannot express "no prerelease" — `v1.2.3-rc.1` matches it and would reach the publish path. The pattern in `semver.ts` is the only thing that rejects it, which is why `version:check` asserts that `release:verify` is still wired into `validate` at all.

**Bumps come from changesets, never by hand.** `bun run changeset:version` writes `package.json` and the `CHANGELOG.md` section together. The one exception in this repo's history is the manual `0.2.0` → `5.0.0` jump, which changesets structurally cannot do (it can only increment) — recorded in [ADR-0024](../adr/0024-semver-numbering-continues-legacy-major-line.md).

### `bun run version:check` (in the `check` chain)

The model above used to be enforced only by `release:verify`, inside a job that runs _because_ a tag was pushed. Every way of getting it wrong therefore stayed green on `main` and surfaced only once the tag was public — and §Rollback is explicit that a published tag is never re-cut over. `version:check` moves the same model to every commit:

| Rule                                   | What it catches                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `package-version`                      | `package.json` is not `X.Y.Z` — prerelease, truncated, leading zero, or carrying a `v`.                |
| `changelog-headings`                   | A `## ` heading that is not a release version (a stray `## Unreleased` re-slices release notes).       |
| `changelog-order`                      | Sections not strictly newest-to-oldest, or a duplicated section.                                       |
| `changelog-newest`                     | The newest section disagrees with `package.json` — a bump whose changelog entry was never written.     |
| `tag-namespace`                        | A tag that is not `vX.Y.Z`.                                                                            |
| `version-behind-tags`                  | `package.json` sitting BELOW the newest published tag, so the next bump would re-issue a taken number. |
| `release-trigger` / `release-backstop` | The `v*.*.*` glob left without the `release:verify` step that constrains it.                           |
| `changeset-frontmatter`                | A pending changeset declaring an invalid bump or a foreign package name.                               |

**Six tags predate the model** — `2.9.9`, `2.12.0`, `3.0.0`, `3.1.0`, `4.3.1`, `4.5.0` — all cut by the legacy codebase's tooling before the rebuild (ADR-0024), and `3.0.0` sits on commit `b23d3308` beside `v3.0.0`: one release under two names. They are a closed, exact-name exemption list in `scripts/version-check.ts`; a seventh cannot be added without editing it. Every one of the 15 tags cut since `v5.1.0` (2026-07-16) already conforms — this gate turns that streak into an invariant.

> **The tag rule needs tags to see.** A default `actions/checkout` is shallow and fetches none, so the rule would report `UNENFORCED` forever — green, and blind. `ci.yml`'s `quality` job therefore sets `fetch-tags: true`, and `tests/version-check.test.ts` asserts that line is still there, so it cannot be removed silently.

## 1. PR-time gate: `changesets.yml`

`scripts/changeset-policy-check.ts` (`bun run changesets:policy:check`) decides whether a PR needs a new changeset, using this repo's own merged-PR history as ground truth for what counts as "docs-only/chore":

- **Exempt** (no changeset needed): `docs/**`, `.claude/**`, `.changeset/**`, any `*.md` file.
- **Not exempt** (changeset required): everything else, including `.github/**` workflows, `scripts/**`, `src/**`, `sql/**`, `openapi/**`, `asyncapi/**`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*.yml`, and test files.

When a new `.changeset/*.md` file is added, its frontmatter is validated (`"awcms": major|minor|patch` — this repo is single-package, so no other package name is valid). A one-off path exception list (`CHANGESET_POLICY_PATH_EXEMPTIONS` in the script) is available for genuine false positives, mirroring the `CONFIG_EXEMPTIONS`/`LOGGING_LINT_EXEMPTIONS` pattern already used elsewhere in this repo where adopted.

This check runs as its own workflow (`changesets.yml`), not as an extra step inside `ci.yml`'s `quality` job or `bun run check`, because it is inherently PR-diff shaped (it needs the `origin/main` tip to compare against) — every other step in `check` is self-contained and safe to run against a single checkout with no network/git-history dependency.

## 2. Tag-time release: `release.yml`

Two entry points, both converging on the same job graph:

| Trigger                           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `push` of a tag matching `v*.*.*` | **Real release.** Publishes the image, then — only once the approval gate is passed — the GitHub Release, and only then moves `:latest`. These are three separate events, not one (ADR-0117). |
| `workflow_dispatch` (any ref)     | **Rehearsal.** Runs the identical pipeline against image tag `dryrun-<sha>`. No GitHub Release is created, `:latest` is never touched.                                                        |

### `validate` job (read-only)

1. **Ancestor-of-main guard** (real releases only) — `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main`. As long as this repo has no branch protection rule on `main`, this guard is the workflow-level substitute for "publish only from a protected branch": a tag whose commit is not part of `origin/main`'s history is rejected before anything is built.
2. **`bun run release:verify`** (real releases only, `scripts/release-verify.ts`) — makes sure the pushed tag matches the `vX.Y.Z` model (§0), that its version matches `package.json`, that `CHANGELOG.md` has a `## X.Y.Z` section for it (`## [X.Y.Z]` is also accepted, for hand-written sections such as the ADR-0024 jump), and that there are no unconsumed changeset files left in `.changeset/`. Most of this is now also checked at every commit by `version:check`; what stays exclusive to release time is the tag↔`package.json` comparison (there is no tag before the push) and the demand that `.changeset/` be empty (it is deliberately full between releases).

   The tag being verified comes from `RELEASE_VERIFY_TAG`, which `release.yml` sets from `github.ref_name`. The local fallback resolves it with `git tag --points-at HEAD` filtered to `vX.Y.Z`, **not** `git describe --exact-match`: commit `b23d3308` carries both `3.0.0` and `v3.0.0`, and `describe` picks between them by git's internal ordering rather than by the model — reporting a pattern failure against a tag nobody chose, with nothing in the message naming the second tag as the cause.

3. **`bun run check`** (against a real, already-migrated Postgres service) — the full quality gate, re-verified at release time rather than trusted from a possibly stale CI result. This must be **stricter** than `ci.yml`'s `quality` job, not identical to it — make sure every step `bun run check` runs is also run by `ci.yml`'s `quality` job (e.g. `i18n:pot:check`, `config:docs:check`, `logging:lint:check`, `api:docs:check`, `repo:inventory:check`) so that this kind of drift cannot merge to `main` through a green PR and only surface on a tag push.

   (Historical note: an older version of this paragraph suggested adding `extension:check` — derived-application manifest compatibility — to the `check` composite and to `ci.yml`. That advice **no longer applies**: the derived-application pathway together with `extension:check` has been **revoked by [ADR-0034](../adr/0034-awcms-family-direct-use-templates-and-derived-pathway-removal.md)**. The principle stands: every new check added to `package.json`'s `check` composite must also become an explicit named step in `ci.yml`'s `quality` job in the same PR, so the same class of drift cannot appear.)

### `build` job (unprivileged: `contents: read`, `packages: write` only)

Runs identically for a real release and a rehearsal. Deliberately holds no signing/attestation credentials (`id-token`/`attestations`) — see below.

1. Build `Dockerfile.production` with Docker Buildx, push to `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms` tagged `<version>` (or `dryrun-<sha>` for a rehearsal) and `sha-<commit>`. **`:latest` is NOT produced here** — this job runs before the approval gate, so anything it tags is public and unsigned; see the `promote-latest` job below and [ADR-0117](../adr/0117-latest-moves-only-after-the-approval-that-signs-it.md).
2. **SBOM** — two separate CycloneDX JSON SBOMs via [`anchore/sbom-action`](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action) (Syft behind it): one for the **source tree** (`bun.lock` + workspace, `sbom-source.cdx.json`) and one for the **built container image** (`sbom-image.cdx.json`) — the two can differ (the image SBOM also reflects the base image's OS packages, not just `bun.lock`).
3. **Checksums** — `CHECKSUMS.txt` (SHA-256) covers both SBOMs and a `git archive` source tarball.
4. Uploads all of the above as a short-lived (1 day) workflow artifact for the next job to download.

### `sign-attest-publish` job (`environment: release`)

Gated behind a GitHub Environment named `release` (see §Environment approval below). It is split out of `build` into its own job for a security reason: the `id-token`/`attestations` permissions are JOB-scoped in GitHub Actions, so every step in a job holding them can mint its own OIDC token — keeping the third-party `anchore/sbom-action` entirely out of this job means a hypothetical supply-chain compromise of that action never has OIDC/attestation credentials to abuse. Runs identically for a real release and a rehearsal:

1. **Signing** — `cosign sign --yes` against the image digest produced by the `build` job, **keyless OIDC** (no signing key ever exists; the identity is this workflow run itself, backed by the GitHub Actions OIDC token and Sigstore's Fulcio/Rekor).
2. **Attestation/provenance** — `actions/attest-build-provenance` for the image digest (pushed to the registry too) and for the three source artifacts (`CHECKSUMS.txt`, `sbom-source.cdx.json`, source tarball); `actions/attest` (with `sbom-path`) associates `sbom-image.cdx.json` with the image digest specifically. All of these are GitHub's own SLSA-compatible attestation store — no separate infrastructure to run/maintain.
3. **Publish** (real releases only) — extracts this version's section from `CHANGELOG.md` as the release body and runs `gh release create`, attaching `CHECKSUMS.txt` and both SBOMs plus the source tarball as release assets.

### `promote-latest` job (real releases only; `packages: write` only)

Retags `:latest` on both `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms` and `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms-jobs` to the digest that was just signed and attested. It declares no `environment:` of its own — `needs: [build, sign-attest-publish]` already makes it unreachable until the gate is approved, and a second approval prompt for the same decision would be friction without a second decision behind it. It is a separate job rather than extra steps in `sign-attest-publish` for that job's own reason: `id-token`/`attestations` are job-scoped, so keeping `docker/setup-buildx-action` out of the privileged job preserves the containment property described above.

The retag is a REGISTRY operation, not a Docker one: `GET /v2/<name>/manifests/<digest>` then `PUT /v2/<name>/manifests/latest` with the same bytes and `Content-Type`. Byte-identical content hashes identically, so `:latest` cannot land anywhere but the signed digest — the application image is bound by `@<digest>`, the exact digest handed to `cosign sign`. `docker buildx imagetools create` was tried first and CANNOT do this: it always emits a new manifest list wrapping its source, which is a different digest, and an attestation is bound to a digest. The `v10.0.3` release failed exactly there; see ADR-0117 §Amendment. A final step re-reads the registry's own `Docker-Content-Digest` for `:latest` and fails the job unless it matches.

It runs **after** the GitHub Release is published, not before. Both orderings keep `:latest` signed, but the release-notes step is the one that has actually failed in this pipeline (`v7.0.0`, a 186,449-character body, after the image was already pushed) — promoting last means such a failure leaves `:latest` on the previous release, rather than pointing at a version with no Release describing it. See [ADR-0117](../adr/0117-latest-moves-only-after-the-approval-that-signs-it.md).

## Why `anchore/sbom-action` (Syft) for SBOM generation

- Produces CycloneDX **and** SPDX (this pipeline uses CycloneDX for both scans — one format is simpler for consumers to diff/tool against; both satisfy the "CycloneDX or SPDX" criterion).
- A self-contained composite action wrapping a single statically-linked Go binary (Syft) — it does not invoke `npm`/`node` against this repo or require a Node.js-based SBOM generator (`@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` and friends are npm-ecosystem-only and would conflict with the Bun-only rule in `AGENTS.md`). It only reads `bun.lock`/the filesystem/the built image — it never executes this project's own code.
- One action covers both scan targets (`path:` for the source tree, `image:` for the built container), so there is only one new third-party action to pin and audit, not two different tools.

## Environment approval (manual maintainer step)

`sign-attest-publish` declares `environment: release`. `build` does not, because it holds no signing/attestation credentials — gating it would not contain anything the job can already do with them, and it is where the third-party `anchore/sbom-action` deliberately runs.

> **What the gate does and does not cover.** It gates _signing, attestation, the GitHub Release, and (since [ADR-0117](../adr/0117-latest-moves-only-after-the-approval-that-signs-it.md)) the `:latest` tag_. It does **not** gate the image push itself: `build` publishes `:<version>` and `:sha-<commit>` as soon as the tag is pushed, before any approval. Those tags are immutable and inert — nothing resolves to them unless a consumer asks for that exact version — so a release that is never approved leaves them behind and moves nothing else. This paragraph previously said gating `build` would add "friction with no security benefit"; that was true of credentials and false of publication, because `build` also emitted `:latest`. Four releases (`v8.0.0`, `v9.0.0`, `v9.1.0`, `v9.1.1`) sat unapproved at this gate for over a week each while `:latest` already pointed at their unsigned images. ADR-0117 moved `:latest` behind the gate; the rest of this paragraph stands. Referencing an environment name in a workflow **auto-creates an unprotected environment record** on the first run if it does not exist — this does **not**, by itself, pause the job for approval. Configuring **required reviewers** on that environment is a repo-admin/shared-state change deliberately left for a maintainer to apply explicitly:

**Via the GitHub UI:** Settings → Environments → New environment → name it exactly `release` → **Required reviewers** → add at least one maintainer → Save protection rules. Every run of `release.yml`'s publish job (real release **and** rehearsal) will then pause at "Waiting for review" until an approved reviewer clicks **Approve and deploy**.

**`gh api` equivalent** (run by a repo admin; replace `<reviewer-user-id>` with the numeric GitHub user id of each required reviewer, from `gh api users/<login> --jq .id`):

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/ahliweb/awcms/environments/release \
  -f 'reviewers[][type]=User' \
  -F 'reviewers[][id]=<reviewer-user-id>'
```

Until this is applied, `release.yml` still runs end-to-end (both entry points) with no pause — every other control in this document (ancestor-of-main guard, `release:verify`, the full quality gate, least-privilege per-job permissions, actions pinned by SHA) is independent of this step.

## Dry-run / rehearsal path

Trigger `release.yml` manually — GitHub UI: **Actions → Release → Run workflow** (pick any branch; `main` is the sensible default), or:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo ahliweb/awcms --ref main
```

This runs the pipeline **in full** — image build, both SBOMs, checksums, keyless signing, provenance/SBOM attestation, and the `release` environment approval gate (once configured) — against a throwaway `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:dryrun-<short-sha>` tag. It never creates a GitHub Release and never moves `:latest`, so it cannot be mistaken for (or accidentally become) a production release. Rehearse this at least once, with a reviewer actually approving the environment gate, before the first real `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed.

Rehearsal images pile up in the `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms` package under `dryrun-*` tags; a maintainer can delete old ones periodically via the package's **Manage versions** page or `gh api -X DELETE /orgs/ahliweb/packages/container/awcms/versions/<id>` — not automated by this pipeline, because automatic deletion needs `packages: delete`, a permission no job here needs.

## Verification (consumer side — no repository secrets needed)

Every check below uses only public data (the registry, the GitHub public attestation API, the Sigstore public transparency log) — none of them needs access to this repo's secrets/CI environment.

> **The image tag is NOT prefixed with `v`.** `release.yml` computes `VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"`, so Git tag `v7.0.1` publishes `ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:7.0.1` (+ `:latest`, `:sha-<12>`). `…:v7.0.1` does not exist in the registry and every command below will fail with "manifest unknown" if the `v` is written along with it. Replace `X.Y.Z` below with the version without the `v`.

```bash
# 1. Verify the image's SLSA build provenance attestation
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:X.Y.Z \
  --owner ahliweb

# 2. Verify the image's SBOM attestation
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:X.Y.Z \
  --owner ahliweb --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom

# 3. Verify the keyless cosign signature directly (without the gh CLI)
cosign verify ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms:X.Y.Z \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "^https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com

# 4. Verify provenance for the downloadable source artifacts
gh attestation verify CHECKSUMS.txt --owner ahliweb
gh attestation verify sbom-source.cdx.json --owner ahliweb

# 5. Verify checksums for anything downloaded from the GitHub Release
sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS.txt
```

`gh attestation verify` and `cosign verify` both work against public, anonymous GitHub/Sigstore identities — none of the five commands above needs a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a repository secret, or any maintainer credential.

## Rollback / yank guidance

Neither Changesets nor this pipeline ever deletes or rewrites an already-published version — consistent with the append-only spirit of the audit trail rule in `AGENTS.md` (applied here to release artifacts, not domain data). To recover from a bad release:

1. **Do not delete the git tag, the GitHub Release, or the `ghcr.io` image/tag.** Consumers may already have pulled that release; deleting it takes away even their ability to diagnose what they have.
2. **Mark the GitHub Release as a pre-release** (`gh release edit vX.Y.Z --prerelease`) and add a note at the top of its body pointing at the fixed version.
3. **Cut a new patch release** (`vX.Y.Z+1`) through the normal path (changeset → `changeset:version` → tag → `release.yml`) with the fix. Do not force-push a corrected tag over the same version number — the image digest and attestations already published for the old tag would silently point at different bytes than the tag name implies, which defeats the entire purpose of the checksum/signature/provenance chain this document describes.
4. If the image is already deployed, redeploy pinned to the new version's **digest** (`ghcr.io/ahliweb/awcms@sha256:...`, from `CHECKSUMS.txt` or `docker buildx imagetools inspect`), not a floating tag, to guarantee exactly which bytes are running.

- `scripts/changeset-policy-check.ts` / `scripts/release-verify.ts` — the pure-function policy checks underpinning both workflows, unit-tested in `tests/`.

## After a release: post-release review (step 18)

Within one working week after a tag is deployed, write one entry in
[`post-release-reviews.md`](post-release-reviews.md) using
[`templates/post-release-review-template.md`](templates/post-release-review-template.md).

A release that went smoothly **still** gets an entry, and four lines are fine.
A register that only contains incidents teaches its readers that releases are
usually troubled, and removes the only baseline that makes a bad release
look bad.
