/**
 * Theme asset media resolution composition root (ADR-0034 Fase 3; ported from
 * awcms-micro Issue #269/ADR-0029 §7). Lives in `src/lib` (never inside the
 * module's own `application`/`domain`) because it is where the media adapter is
 * wired into `theming` — the ports-and-adapters composition-root convention.
 *
 * ## What this used to do, and why it changed
 *
 * This returned an EMPTY map. When the seam was written that was honest:
 * ADR-0034 Fase 3 ported `theming` first and there was no media module to
 * resolve against. The header said so, and stayed saying so after ADR-0036
 * landed `media_library` — so the no-op read as a deliberate design rather than
 * an unfinished wire, and the consequence went unnoticed: a tenant could upload
 * a logo, the id was stored and valid, and `PublicThemeLayout` rendered the
 * theme-name fallback forever, because this function reported no assets.
 *
 * It now resolves through `MediaLibraryPort`, the same capability
 * `blog_content` and `news_portal` already consume.
 *
 * ## Safety comes from the port, not from here
 *
 * `resolveMediaReferences` returns entries ONLY for ids that exist, belong to
 * this tenant, and are `verified`/`attached`. An unsafe, cross-tenant, or
 * deleted id is simply absent from the map — never thrown. So the degradation
 * this function was already designed around is preserved exactly: an
 * unresolvable slot is omitted and the theme falls back, which matters because
 * a theme is public-facing and must not 500 on a stale asset id.
 *
 * That also means this file performs no validation of its own. Adding an
 * ownership or status check here would duplicate the port's contract in a
 * second place that could drift from it.

 * omission paths (unsafe id, cross-tenant id, empty config) without a database.
