/**
 * `/admin/email-suppression` gates against the endpoints it drives — Issue #544.
 *
 * Sibling of the other page-contract tests, for the same silent failure: a page
 * gating on a permission key no migration seeds hides the control from EVERYONE
 * — including the owner — while still looking like a working screen.
 *
 * This screen has two properties of its own worth pinning:
 *
 * - **`alreadySuppressed` is an ANSWER, not an error.** The endpoint replies 200
 *   with that flag instead of 409, which makes one request serve as both "add"
 *   and "is this address already on the list?". Reloading on it would throw away
 *   the only thing the operator asked for — and the masked, bounded list cannot
 *   answer the question any other way.
 * - **No raw address is ever rendered.** The store returns `recipient_masked`
 *   and nothing else; a page that reached for a raw field would be reaching for
 *   one that does not exist, but the assertion is what keeps it that way if one
 *   ever appears.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
