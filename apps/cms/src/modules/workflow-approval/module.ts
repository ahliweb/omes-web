    "Managed, versioned workflow-definition engine ported from awcms-mini's proven workflow-approval module: draft/publish/retire lifecycle with immutable published/retired versions and version pinning per instance, generic nodes/transitions (sequential approval, bounded conditional routing, parallel/join fan-out/fan-in, notify), quorum/any/all approval rules, effective-dated delegation/substitution, escalation/timeout policies processed by a scheduled worker job, and administrative recovery (reassign/cancel/force-decision) with explicit permissions, reason, Idempotency-Key, and full audit. Self-approval guard reused unchanged from identity_access's ABAC evaluator. Module-contributed condition resolvers/actions are a static, reviewed-source-code registry (`infrastructure/condition-action-registry.ts`) — never runtime-registered or arbitrary tenant-supplied code (doc 21 §3 decision tree, node Q5).
