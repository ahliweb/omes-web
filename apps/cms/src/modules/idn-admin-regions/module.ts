/**
 * `idn_admin_regions` — Official Optional Module admitted by ADR-0046: versioned
 * master data for Indonesia's administrative hierarchy (province / regency-city
 * / district / village), sourced from the vendored third-party dataset
 * `cahyadsn/wilayah` (MIT). Admission, schema, import pipeline, dataset
 * lifecycle, and the read-only lookup API land together.
 *
 * ## What this module OWNS
 *
 * `awcms_idn_region_datasets` (one row per imported version, with upstream
 * provenance and lifecycle status) and `awcms_idn_admin_regions` (the 91,599
 * normalized regions of one version) — both `sql/080`. Plus the import job
 * (`bun run idn-regions:import`), the activate/rollback actions, and
 * `/api/v1/idn-regions/*`.
 *
 * ## GLOBAL reference data — the deliberate exception (ADR-0046 §3)
 *
 * Neither table has `tenant_id` or RLS: province "Aceh" is the same row for
 * every tenant, the way `awcms_permissions`/`awcms_modules` are. Both are
 * registered in `GLOBAL_TABLE_FORBIDDEN_PRIVILEGES`
 * (`scripts/security-readiness.ts`), which forces an explicit per-role privilege
 * declaration instead of inheriting blanket DML. What is global is the ROW, not
 * the permission — every endpoint still runs session + tenant context +
 * default-deny ABAC.
 *
 * ## Import is job-only; activation/rollback are job AND HTTP (ADR-0052 → ADR-0053)
 *
 * Import never had an HTTP surface, per ADR-0046 §5 ("no request-time subject
 * for an ABAC guard to evaluate"). It is the only one of the three lifecycle
 * actions that is exclusively a job.
 *
 * Activation and rollback are different, and their history matters. They
 * shipped as ABAC-gated tenant endpoints, on the reasoning that "who switched
 * the platform to which version" is a request-path decision. That reasoning was
 * wrong in a way that mattered: the permissions it required
 * (`dataset.configure`/`.restore`) sat in the GLOBAL catalog, which
 * `setup/initialize` grants wholesale to every tenant's `owner` — so an ordinary
 * tenant owner could swap the dataset served to every OTHER tenant, and ABAC saw
 * nothing wrong because it evaluates the permission, not who the action affects.
 *
 * ADR-0052 (1 August 2026) deleted both the endpoints and the permissions
 * (`sql/084`) rather than guard them, because the primitive that could gate a
 * cross-tenant action safely — a permission scope the blanket grant could
 * exclude — did not exist yet. ADR-0053 (2 August 2026, one day later) built
 * that primitive and brought both back: `dataset.configure`/`.restore` are real,
 * `scope: "platform"` permissions again (`sql/085`, see `permissions` below),
 * and `access-guard.ts` refuses them unless the acting tenant IS the platform
 * tenant. `POST /api/v1/idn-regions/datasets/{id}/activate` and `/rollback` are
 * live endpoints, not history.
 *
 * The operator jobs below (`idn-regions:activate`/`:rollback`) were never
 * removed and remain the path for CI, a recovery shell, or a deployment whose
 * platform tenant cannot log in. The two doors are not equivalent — see
 * `description` for the audit divergence between them.
 *
 * ## `type: "system"` — divergence from awcms-mini, on purpose
 *
 * `awcms-mini` typed this module `base`. This repo has no `base`-typed module at
 * all, while `media_library` already established "System Foundation,
 * `isCore: false`" for exactly this shape: a shared capability owned by the
 * platform rather than by a tenant. Introducing a third type value for one
 * module would add a category every gate and matrix has to answer, buying no
 * behaviour (ADR-0046 §2).
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT here
 *
 * No `capabilities`: consumers read the lookup API, and a capability port would
 * be indirection with one implementation. No `events`: nothing subscribes to
 * region changes, and an unconsumed channel is a claim without a reader. No
 * `dataLifecycle`: these tables are versioned reference data, never purged by
 * age — a dataset is superseded, not aged out. The island/population/area dumps
 * are vendored but read by no code.

  description:
    "Versioned master data for Indonesia's administrative hierarchy — province / regency-city / district / village (38 / 514 / 7,285 / 83,762 rows in the currently vendored dataset) — for address forms, branch and coverage mapping, and regional reporting (ADR-0046). Owns `awcms_idn_region_datasets` and `awcms_idn_admin_regions` (sql/080), both GLOBAL reference data with no tenant_id and no RLS: the rows are identical for every tenant, exactly like the permission and module registries, and both are registered in `GLOBAL_TABLE_FORBIDDEN_PRIVILEGES` so each role's privileges are declared explicitly rather than inherited. Data comes from the vendored third-party dataset `cahyadsn/wilayah` (MIT) under `data/idn-admin-regions/`, whose bytes, checksums, upstream commit, and per-file Kepmendagri decree reference are committed alongside it — this is a community packaging of the decree, NOT an official Kementerian Dalam Negeri API or export, and that caveat is carried in code and in the API response. Importing parses the vendored SQL dump as TEXT (no SQL engine, no MySQL, no network), validates it whole (unparsed line, duplicate code, orphaned parent, or a missing tier all fail the import rather than importing a partial hierarchy — with `--commit`, the failure is recorded as its own `rejected` dataset row with the reason, Issue #768, never as region rows), and writes one new dataset version alongside the previous one — never over it, which is what makes rollback a status flip instead of a re-import. Import runs as the `awcms_worker` job `bun run idn-regions:import` (dry-run by default, `--commit` to write) and always lands `validated`; making a version the one that is SERVED is a separate operator job (`bun run idn-regions:activate`, with `bun run idn-regions:rollback` to undo), also dry-run by default. Both are also reachable over HTTP — `POST /api/v1/idn-regions/datasets/{id}/activate` and `/rollback` — gated on the platform-scoped permissions `dataset.configure`/`.restore` (ADR-0053, seeded by `sql/085`): excluded from the blanket grant every new tenant's `owner` receives, and refused by the authorization chokepoint unless the acting tenant IS the platform tenant. ADR-0052 had revoked both permissions and removed both endpoints for a day (`sql/084`) precisely because that platform scope did not exist yet to gate them safely; ADR-0053 built it and brought both back. The two doors are not equivalent: the HTTP endpoint writes an `awcms_audit_events` row to the platform tenant's log, while the operator job writes none, because that table is tenant-scoped and this action is global — a deliberate, documented cost of the job path, not an oversight. The single-active rule is enforced by a partial unique index in the database rather than by an application check two concurrent callers could interleave through. The read-only lookup API (`/api/v1/idn-regions/*`) defaults to the active dataset, supports tier/parent/name filters with keyset pagination, and can be pointed at a superseded version for comparison.",
