/**
 * Per-tenant orchestration for the R2 media lifecycle cleanup &
 * reconciliation job (Issue #690, epic #679 platform-hardening —
 * "runtime/worker hardening" wave, following #691/#689/#694/#695/#687/#697).
 * `scripts/news-media-r2-reconcile.ts` is the thin CLI wrapper (`runJob`
 * integration, tenant loop, telemetry); this file holds the actual logic so
 * `tests/integration/news-media-r2-reconciliation-job.integration.test.ts`
 * can exercise it directly against a real Postgres + fake R2 HTTP server,
 * same convention `runAuditLogPurge` (`scripts/audit-log-purge.ts`)
 * established.
 *
 * ## Ordering discipline — two DIFFERENT orderings, each independently justified
 *
 * (Corrected — reviewer finding on PR #718: this header previously claimed
 * a single "DB claim first" ordering applied to "both cleanup paths." It
 * does not; the two paths are ordered oppositely, for two different
 * reasons, neither of which is an oversight.)
 *
 * **`expiredPending` (`cleanupExpiredPending`): DB claim FIRST, R2 delete
 * SECOND.** `r2-backup-lifecycle.md` §2 asks for "hapus objek R2 dulu, baru
 * hapus baris metadata" for CRASH safety, but this path claims the DB row
 * first instead — deliberately:
 *
 * - The DB claim uses the SAME "guarded UPDATE...WHERE, Postgres serializes
 *   concurrent writers" idiom `finalizeNewsMediaUploadSession` already uses
 *   for its own atomic claim — doing the R2 call FIRST would mean a
 *   concurrently in-flight `finalize()` call could win the race AFTER this
 *   job already deleted the object out from under it. Claiming in the DB
 *   first is what makes "never delete a row that is genuinely still being
 *   finalized" possible at all (this repo's critical acceptance criterion
 *   for this job) — `pending_upload`/`uploaded` rows CAN be raced against a
 *   real, concurrently-running upload/finalize flow.
 * - The failure mode the doc's ordering avoids (a stray R2 object with no
 *   matching DB row) is NOT a dead end here — it is EXACTLY the
 *   `orphanInR2` category `news-media-reconciliation-categorization.ts`
 *   independently detects and eventually cleans up on a LATER run. A crash
 *   between this module's DB claim and its R2 delete therefore self-heals,
 *   just on the next scheduled run instead of instantly.
 *
 * There WAS a third path here, `cleanupStaleOrphaned`, and it is gone
 * (finding D16). It cleaned up `status = 'orphaned'` rows past a grace period,
 * and `markNewsMediaObjectOrphaned` was this repo's only writer of that status
 * and had zero callers — so the path ran, found nothing, and printed
 * `staleOrphaned(total=0,deleted=0,deferred=0)` on every run. A zero counter
 * and a clean bucket read identically, which made the summary line a claim
 * nobody could check. Its own docblock even reasoned carefully about a race
 * that could not occur, because no row could be in the state it guarded.
 *
 * ## Idempotency across reruns
 *
 * Every mutation below is a guarded UPDATE/DELETE that only succeeds if the
 * row is STILL in the exact state that made it eligible. Once a row is
 * hard-deleted (`expiredPending`), it no longer appears in the NEXT run's
 * `fetchNewsMediaObjectsForReconciliation` snapshot — so a rerun with nothing new to do performs zero
 * mutations and reports the same `healthy` set, by construction, not by a
 * separate "already processed" bookkeeping mechanism.
 *
 * ## Provider outage handling
 *
 * `r2Client.listObjects`/`deleteObject` never throw (same convention as
 * every other method on `NewsMediaR2Client` — see that file's header) — a
 * provider error is a normal `{ ok: false, error }` return. A `listObjects`
 * failure aborts THIS TENANT's reconciliation only (returns
 * `r2ListFailed: true`, no DB mutation attempted, `orphanInR2` cannot be
 * computed without a listing) and the caller continues to the next tenant —
 * one tenant's R2 outage never blocks another tenant's, and never blocks
 * unrelated DB-only work elsewhere in the process. A `deleteObject` failure
 * for one candidate is deferred (counted, logged, left for the next run) —
 * it never aborts the rest of that tenant's cleanup loop.
