  /**
   * Issue #468, ADR-0072. ONE descriptor, because this module now owns one
   * high-volume table.
   *
   * It used to own two on paper. `awcms_sync_outbox` had **zero producers
   * repo-wide** — nothing INSERTed into it, so `POST /api/v1/sync/pull`, its
   * only reader, could never return anything but an empty list. A retention
   * descriptor for it would have been fiction twice over: a terminal-status
   * predicate that could never match, on a table that could not grow.
   * ADR-0077 answered the question that actually mattered — whether it should
   * exist at all — and retired it (`sql/099`); `/sync/pull` now reads
   * `awcms_domain_events`, this repo's one transactional outbox.
   *
   * ## Why `delegated`
   *
   * `HighVolumeTableDescriptor` carries a `cursorColumn` and no status
   * predicate, so the generic executor deletes purely by age. Pointed at this
   * queue it would delete uploads that have not happened yet — including rows
   * in `sending`, which are claimed by a dispatcher pass whose lease is the
   * only thing that recovers them.
