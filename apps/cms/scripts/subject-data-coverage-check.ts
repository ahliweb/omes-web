/**
 * `bun run subject-data:coverage:check` — ADR-0094, Issue #542.
 *
 * Every `awcms_*` table must have ANSWERED the subject question. Not answered
 * it the same way — answered it at all.
 *
 * The question is one sentence: **how does this table answer about a data
 * subject.** Three answers are accepted and silence is not:
 *
 * - a `subjectData` descriptor — declared by the owning module, naming which
 *   column joins a row to the person, whether it exports, and what erasure
 *   means for it;
 * - `NO_SUBJECT_DATA` — a reasoned refusal, for a table that holds nothing
 *   about a person. A new entry is a sentence a reviewer can disagree with;
 * - `TABLES_PREDATING_THE_SUBJECT_RULE` — the tables that already existed. It
 *   may only SHRINK, and an entry that has since gained a descriptor is an
 *   error rather than a tolerated duplicate. **It is now EMPTY** (Issue #557):
 *   the 139 tables it carried have each answered, so there is no table left in
 *   this schema whose answer is "it was here first".
 *
 * ## Why this gate lands before any endpoint
 *
 * An export endpoint that landed first would export the tables its author
 * happened to remember and stay silent about the rest. A subject-access report
 * that is incomplete is worse than none, because it is signed. This makes
 * completeness a property the schema enforces rather than one a PR claims.
 *
 * The shape is `data-lifecycle:table-coverage:check` (#437) deliberately
 * copied, down to the table derivation, so there is one idea to learn and not
 * two that can drift apart.
 *
 * The ledger carried no per-entry reason, for the same reason its sibling
 * carries none: one reason covered all of them — they predated the rule — and
 * inventing 139 individual justifications would have manufactured exactly the
 * fiction this file exists to avoid. Its length was a debt counter, printed on
 * every run, and Issue #557 paid it down to nothing.
 *
 * ## What an empty ledger changes
 *
 * It is deliberately kept as an empty array rather than deleted, because the
 * gate's shape is what makes the guarantee hold: with nothing in it, EVERY
 * table must produce a descriptor or a reasoned refusal, and re-adding a line
 * is an edit somebody has to make on purpose in a file whose only content is
 * work not done. Deleting the export would remove the place where that
 * regression would have to be written down.
 *
 * Zero is also the precondition Issue #557's export endpoint needed. A
 * subject-access report assembled while 139 tables had never answered would
 * have been complete-looking and wrong — signed, which is worse than absent.
 * Completeness is now a property the schema enforces rather than one a PR
 * claims.
 *
 * Pure — reads `sql/` and the module registry, no database.

It records nothing the tenant holds ABOUT a third party, which is what a subject-access request asks for; a reader exercising their rights against this site is not asking for the site's own address. The honest edge case, stated rather than skipped: a small newsroom may type a person's address into `contact_email` or `whatsapp_number`. That value is still the publisher's own, published deliberately by the person who typed it, and erasing it is editing the field on `/admin/site-profile` — not a subject-rights workflow, which would have no way to distinguish it from the masthead it sits beside. It is also why the audit row for a change records WHICH FIELDS are set and never their values: the values do not need a second copy in a store more people read."
