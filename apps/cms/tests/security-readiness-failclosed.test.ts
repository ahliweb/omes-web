/**
 * Issue #162 / L2 — real-PostgreSQL test that `checkRuntimeRoleGrants` fails
 * CLOSED for a global, RLS-free table that is registered as RLS-free (as one
 * would to satisfy `checkRlsEnabled`) but carries NO explicit privilege
 * declaration in the forbidden-privilege map.
 *
 * Before this fix such a table was `continue`d as "full DML kept by design" and
 * passed silently — the exact "a new global table inherits blanket DML from
 * `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`" regression the check exists to catch. The 9 real
 * tables are curated correctly and merged into ONE source of truth, so the
 * divergence cannot occur in shipped code; the guard is exercised here by
 * INJECTING a divergent policy (`rlsFreeTables` augmented with a probe table
 * the default forbidden map does not know about). Injection — not `mock.module`
 * — because stubbing a shared module leaks across every later test file in the
 * same process (PR #157: green locally, 12 CI failures on the same commit).
 *
 * Requires `awcms_app` (sql/019) and the narrowed grants (sql/021) to be
 * present. Gated on `DATABASE_URL`, same convention as
 * `security-readiness-rls.test.ts`: `ci.yml`'s `quality` job has no database
 * so it skips cleanly; this actually executes in `ci.yml`'s
 * `integration-tests` job and `release.yml`'s `validate` job, each in a
 * dedicated `bun test <legacy files>` step run separately from the
 * harness-based `tests/integration/` suite (see `tests/integration/
 * harness.ts` — the two collide if run together in one `bun test` process).
 *
 * The suite only creates/drops its own probe table. It NEVER drops or mutates
 * the cluster-wide `awcms_app` role — grants on the probe vanish when the probe
 * is dropped.
