 * `data_lifecycle` (ported from awcms-micro Issue #745, ADR-0037). `type:

 * `logging`/`sync_storage`/`visitor_analytics`: platform/governance
 * infrastructure every tenant shares the mechanism of, not a tenant-facing
 * business feature.
 *
 * This module owns exactly its OWN policy/execution-state tables (legal holds,
 * cursors, archive manifests, run history) — it never owns another module's
 * high-volume table directly (ADR-0013 §6 "no shared-table write"). The
 * high-volume table DESCRIPTORS this engine operates on are declared by each
 * OWNING module's own `module.ts` (`dataLifecycle` field,
 * `_shared/module-contract.ts`) — see `logging`/`visitor_analytics` for the two
 * "delegated" adopters this port re-wires, and this module's own `dataLifecycle`
 * entry below for the one "generic"-execution descriptor the engine dogfoods
 * end-to-end (its own run-history table).
