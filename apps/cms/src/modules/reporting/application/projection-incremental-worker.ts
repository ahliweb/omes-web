/**
 * Generic bounded cursor-scan engine (Issue #753). This is the ONLY
 * mechanism that ever reads a `cursor_table`-strategy projection's (or ANY
 * projection's rebuild) source table(s) — same "SELECT (bounded) -> apply
 * -> advance cursor, all in ONE transaction" shape `data_lifecycle`'s
 * `archive-purge-job.ts` already proved correct (crash-safe, resumable,
 * never double-applies a row on retry because the cursor only advances
 * AFTER the same transaction that applied the batch commits).
 *
 * Table/column identifiers come from CODE-DECLARED descriptors
 * (`ProjectionCursorStream`, never tenant/request input) but are still
 * validated against a strict allow-list pattern here — same defense-in-
 * depth `assertSafeIdentifier` already establishes in `data-lifecycle/
 * application/archive-purge-job.ts` — before being interpolated into a
 * dynamic `tx.unsafe(...)` query (the ONLY way to parameterize a table
 * name at all; every VALUE, including `matchValue`, is still a real bound
 * parameter, never string-concatenated).
 *
 * MUTUAL EXCLUSION WITH REBUILD (Issue #753 critical requirement —
 * idempotent rebuild must never double-count): before touching a (tenant,
 * projection)'s cursor/metric rows, `runCursorStreamPass` takes that
 * (tenant, projection)'s `pg_advisory_xact_lock` (`projection-lock.ts`)
 * and THEN checks `findRunningRebuild` — both INSIDE the same transaction
 * that goes on to read the cursor and apply the deltas — and SKIPS
 * entirely if a rebuild currently owns this projection. This is
 * deliberately simple (skip, don't try to interleave) — a rebuild
 * re-derives the projection's ENTIRE state from a full re-scan of the
 * authoritative source table, so any row written to that table during the
 * rebuild window is guaranteed to already be included in the rebuild's own
 * scan by the time it reaches that row; letting the steady-state path ALSO
 * apply the same row concurrently would double-count it. The same lock +
 * guard is applied by the rebuild engine itself (`projection-rebuild.ts`)
 * and by the event-driven consumer handler
 * (`event-activity-projection.ts`) for the one `domain_event` strategy
 * projection, for the identical reason.
 *
 * Issue #151 (bug fix): this guard used to live in `runIncrementalUpdateForTenant`
 * and open a `withTenant` transaction of its OWN, separate from the one
 * each pass then opened — a textbook TOCTOU. A rebuild triggered in that
 * window reset the cursor to NULL and the metrics to 0 AFTER the guard
 * said "no rebuild is running", so the incremental pass re-scanned the
 * source table from the beginning and the rebuild's own passes did too —
 * both applying the same delta to the same metric row (they serialize on
 * that row lock and therefore SUM). See `projection-lock.ts`'s header for
 * why the lock, and not merely relocating the check, is what actually
 * closes this (READ COMMITTED re-snapshots per STATEMENT, so a check and
 * an act in one transaction are still not atomic with respect to a
 * concurrently committing writer).
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION (cursor ties, inherited from `data_lifecycle`'s own
 * documented limitation — see `archive-purge-job.ts`'s header): resume is
 * `cursorColumn >= cursor + 1ms`. If more rows share the EXACT SAME
 * cursor value (or land within that same 1ms window) than fit in one
 * `batchLimit`-sized page, the ones past the page cutoff are excluded
 * from the NEXT pass too (the `+1ms` pad that correctly stops a
 * boundary row from being re-counted also — unavoidably, with a plain
 * timestamp cursor and no `(cursorValue, id)` tie-breaking — excludes a
 * genuinely different row sharing that same narrow window). Real
 * `awcms_abac_decision_logs`/`identities`/`sync_nodes` writes are
 * ordinary, separately-committed statements spread over real wall-clock
 * time, so this is a narrow edge case in production; it is NOT narrow
 * for a test that seeds many rows inside one transaction (`now()` is
 * STABLE for the whole transaction in Postgres) — such a test MUST
 * assign each row a distinct, explicit `created_at` rather than relying
 * on the column's own `DEFAULT now()` (`tests/reporting-projection-
 * rebuild-lock.test.ts`'s `seedSourceRows` does exactly this).
