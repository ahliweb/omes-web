/**
 * Structural contracts for `checkSsoBreakGlassReady` — the properties that make
 * it worth having, none of which a runtime assertion can observe.
 *
 * The integration suite proves the check reports the right answer. It cannot
 * prove the check is REACHED (a function nobody calls has no behaviour to test)
 * or that it derives its answer from the same rule the write path enforces
 * rather than a second copy that happens to agree today. Both of those are
 * facts about the source, so they are asserted against the source.
 *
 * No database — this runs in `quality` on every PR, where the integration
 * suite does not.
