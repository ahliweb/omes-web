/**
 * Object-storage uploader against a REAL S3-protocol round trip (Issue #154,
 * ported from awcms-mini's `tests/object-storage-uploader.test.ts`).
 *
 * `src/modules/sync-storage/infrastructure/object-storage-uploader.ts` is the
 * ONLY place in this codebase that talks to an external object-storage
 * provider, and it is the concrete implementation of ADR-0006's three
 * promises: the provider is optional, it is never called inside a DB
 * transaction, and a wedged/failing provider must degrade rather than take
 * the app down. None of those are checkable by reading the code — they are
 * properties of what `Bun.S3Client` actually does over a socket. So this
 * suite stands up a real HTTP server on loopback, points the real
 * `Bun.S3Client` at it via the `endpoint` seam the module already exposes for
 * exactly this purpose, and asserts on observed behavior: how many requests
 * were made, with what method and path, and what came back.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN `tests/integration/` DESPITE NEEDING NO DATABASE. It is not
 * a unit test: it binds a socket, speaks HTTP, and exercises a third-party
 * client's real timeout/retry behavior. It is deliberately NOT gated on
 * `DATABASE_URL` — there is no database in it, so gating it would only stop it
 * from running in `ci.yml`, where it is perfectly capable of running and
 * where the ADR-0006 path currently has zero coverage.
 *
 * THE BREAKER IS PROCESS-WIDE STATE, and this suite is the only place that
 * trips it on purpose. `resetProviderCircuitBreakersForTests()` runs in BOTH
 * `beforeEach` and `afterEach` so a tripped breaker can never leak into a
 * neighbouring test file (`bun test` shares one process across files) — the
 * same class of cross-file pollution that made CI red while local was green
 * in PR #157.
