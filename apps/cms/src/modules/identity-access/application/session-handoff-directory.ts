 * sessions even if the mint itself is slow.
 *
 * ## Every failure is one `reason`, and the route collapses them
 *
 * Unknown, expired, already-spent, wrong client, wrong redirect_uri are
 * distinguished HERE, because an operator reading the audit trail needs them.
 * The route answers one generic error, because a caller that can tell "expired"
