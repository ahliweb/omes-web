/**
 * Effective "public route" settings for `blog_content`'s public route family
 * `/blog/{tenantCode}` (Issue #540, ADR-0009).
 *
 * There used to be two families. The host-resolved `/news/**` family (ADR-0059)
 * and its `publicRouteMode` switch were removed by
 * [ADR-0071](../../../../docs/adr/0071-kosakata-url-publik-dibelah-blog-di-sini-news-di-awcms-astro.md)
 * §4, which split the family's URL vocabulary: `/blog/**` is this repo's
 * permanent vocabulary and `/news/**` belongs to `ahliweb/awcms-astro`. A
 * retirement 301 for the old family lives in `seo_distribution`
 * (`domain/retired-news-redirect.ts`), and it reads
 * `legacyTenantRouteEnabled` below for the one condition that survived: a
 * tenant with no `/blog/**` must not be redirected to it.
 *
 * `publicBasePath`/`publicLabel` — the two further keys the archived
 * awcms-micro carries — were NOT adopted (ADR-0059 §4), and that reasoning
 * outlives the family it was written for: they change only the
 * self-referential links a page emits and cannot move the file-based route that
 * actually serves, so setting either to anything but the physical path
 * manufactures per-tenant URLs that 404.
 *
 * Deliberately reads from TWO existing, already-authoritative stores
 * instead of inventing a third:
 *
 * 1. `blog_content`'s module descriptor `settings.defaults` (`module.ts`) +
 *    the tenant's `awcms_module_settings` override, via Module Management's
 *    generic tenant-settings framework (`fetchModuleSettingsView`). Owns
 *    `legacyTenantRouteEnabled`.
 * 2. `awcms_blog_settings` (migration 035, wired up by
 *    `blog-settings-directory.ts`'s `fetchBlogSettings`). Owns
 *    `rssEnabled`/`sitemapEnabled` — NOT duplicated into store (1): two
 *    independent, writable stores for the identical concept would be a real
 *    single-source-of-truth bug — an admin could flip "RSS enabled" off in
 *    the generic module settings store while
 *    `/blog/{tenantCode}/feed.xml.ts` keeps reading the OLD
 *    `awcms_blog_settings` value and stays enabled.
 *
 * `fetchEffectivePublicRouteSettings` merges READ access to both into one
 * DTO so `/blog/{tenantCode}` route handlers don't need to call two
 * functions and remember which field lives where — it does not create a
 * third writable store. Every field's write path is still whichever of the
 * two stores above already owns it: `PATCH /api/v1/tenant/modules/blog_content/settings`
 * for the first, `PATCH /api/v1/blog/settings` for the last two.

/**

 * settings only.
 *
 * Split out for finding B2. `isLegacyTenantRouteEnabled` used to go through the
 * merged reader above, which also reads `awcms_blog_settings` and then throws
 * that row away: a wholly wasted round trip on every anonymous page view of all
 * seven `/blog/{tenantCode}/*` routes — 100% of them on a default deployment,
 * where the edge cache is off.
 *
 * Two of those seven were paying for it TWICE. `feed.xml.ts` and
 * `sitemap-blog.xml.ts` call `isLegacyTenantRouteEnabled` and then call
 * `fetchBlogSettings` themselves for `rssEnabled`/`sitemapEnabled`, so
 * `awcms_blog_settings` was read once and discarded, then read again and used.
 *
 * The normalisation lives here rather than in the caller for the reason the
 * merged reader's own header gives: `validateModuleSettingsPatch` checks the
 * SHAPE of a settings patch, never per-field types, so a tenant override holding
 * a garbage value reaches this read path — and this is where it must fall back
 * to the safe default rather than throw.

 * either serves `/blog/{tenantCode}` or it serves no public content at all.
 * `null` is that second case, and it is the row that carries the rule — the
 * correct sitemap for a tenant with its public surface off is an EMPTY one, not
 * one full of links that are certain to 404. That invariant is restated in
 * ADR-0071 §3 precisely so it did not lapse when ADR-0059 was superseded.
 *
 * Pure (no DB) so the rule itself is directly testable; the caller supplies the
