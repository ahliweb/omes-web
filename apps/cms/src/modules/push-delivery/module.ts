    "Transactional outbox for device push notifications (epic #463, ADR-0074): a `PushProvider` port, the FCM HTTP v1 and Web Push/VAPID adapters, a safe `log` adapter, the tenant-scoped schema/RLS (`sql/093`), a claim/send/finalize dispatcher (`bun run push:dispatch`) with lease-based claiming, backoff, a circuit breaker and a per-attempt ledger, and the HTTP surface plus `/admin/push-notifications` console. It is a SECOND outbox on purpose — `domain-event-runtime` calls its consumers INSIDE the claim transaction by design, and ADR-0006 forbids the external HTTP call a push provider needs from inside a transaction. Generic infrastructure, analogous to `email`: it delivers a notification somebody else decided to send, and owns no notion of what is worth notifying about. Managing one's OWN device is self-service (no permission — the subject is the caller); the three permissions cover what touches other people's rows or makes the deployment emit traffic. Ships INERT — without PUSH_ENABLED=true the dispatcher claims nothing.",
