# AWCMS Project Skills

Project-level Claude Code skills for AWCMS. Each skill encodes the standards from `docs/awcms/` so that coding agents apply them consistently. Skills are invoked automatically by the model when relevant, or manually via `/<skill-name>`.

> Read [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) first for the mandatory rules & workflow.

> **GATED since 4 August 2026 — [ADR-0062](../../docs/adr/0062-skills-are-gated-against-the-code-they-describe.md).**
> `bun run skills:check` (part of `bun run check`) enforces three things, and
> editing a skill can now turn CI red:
>
> 1. **A LIVE module skill describes LIVE code.** If `awcms-<x>`'s subject exists
>    in the module registry, every `` `src/…` `` path it quotes must EXIST. There is
>    no exception to this rule.
> 2. **Every quoted `ADR-NNNN` has a file** under `docs/adr/`.
> 3. **A skill for code that does NOT exist must be registered** in `ASPIRATIONAL_SKILLS`
>    (`scripts/skills-check.ts`) with a reason: `target-spec`, `historical`, or
>    `cross-cutting`.
> 4. **Every `bun run <target>` must exist** in `package.json` or be registered in
>    [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md) §Deferred. §Deferred does
>    allow a skill to name a reference target that has not been built yet — this rule
>    only catches the ones that are neither.
>
> **Writing a path that belongs to an ARCHIVE repo?** Write `` `awcms-mini:src/…` `` /
> `` `awcms-micro:src/…` ``, not `` `src/…` ``. The bodies of many skills here
> carry the mini specification verbatim, and writing the source path as if it were a path in
> this repo is exactly the mistake that is gated.

> **ADR-0055 (2 August 2026) REVOKES the mini-first flow.** `awcms-mini`/`awcms-micro`
> are **ARCHIVES**: they may be read as history/specification, they receive no
> changes, and they are **not a source of scheduled work**. A skill whose body reads
> "port from mini" is a historical note — the desired capability is **built in
> this repo** with its own admission ADR. `awcms-port-from-mini` is kept
> as a record of HOW ports used to be done, not as a work order.

> **Provenance & status (updated 2026-08-08).** These skills were **once** adapted
> from the reference repos [`ahliweb/awcms-mini`](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-mini)
> and [`awcms-micro`](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-micro) — provenance, not a
> working path: that absorption programme was closed by ADR-0055 (see the paragraph above).
> The family today is two repos, `awcms` + [`awcms-astro`](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-astro)
> (public pages + the USER admin surface, ADR-0070). **CORRECTION:** the previous version claimed this
> implementation was "only the Sprint 1–2 foundation" with four modules — that has **not
> been true for a long time**. This repo has **26 registered modules** and migrations
> `sql/001` through `sql/158` plus the `commerce` module's own reserved `sql/901` through `sql/934`;
> see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the real list.
> A skill whose body still marks itself "READ-ONLY" stays that way — that is
> per-skill, not a statement about the repo as a whole.

> **Verify a command before running it.** `package.json` now has **87
> scripts** (checked 5 August 2026), including ones that used to be marked as missing:
> `openapi:bundle`, `data-lifecycle:*`, `reporting:*`,
> `db:work-class:generate`/`db:work-class:check`, and — **correction of 4 August
> 2026** — `repo:inventory:generate`/`repo:inventory:check`, which the earlier
> note still described as "genuinely absent". Both landed in #374
> together with the `awcms/repo-inventory.md` generator.
>
> What is still genuinely absent: `i18n:*`, and `extension:check` (the
> latter was **REMOVED** by ADR-0034, not deferred — do not reference it).

> Still check `package.json` before executing a command from a skill;
> this list moves every time a new module lands, and **this paragraph is not
> what is gated** — `skills:check` (ADR-0062) enforces `SKILL.md`, not this
> file.

## Improvement/hardening catalog

The skills below are **improvement** skills — they assess & raise the quality of artifacts that already exist, rather than building them from scratch. Use them after a feature works, during an audit, or ahead of go-live.

| Skill                      | When to use                                                                               | Docs source                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| `awcms-performance`        | Application & database performance tuning (query, index, pagination, pool)                | 16, 07                               |

| `awcms-security-hardening` | Standards-based security audit (OWASP Top 10, ASVS, ISO 27001)                            | 20, 10, 13                           |

## Maintenance/tooling catalog

The skills below are neither feature building nor audit — they purely keep
mechanical artifacts (docs snapshots, etc.) in sync with external state.

| Skill                   | When to use                                                                                            | Docs source                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `awcms-github-snapshot` | **Target spec only** — `docs/awcms/github/` does not exist here; query `gh` directly for tracker state | awcms-github-snapshot/SKILL.md |
| `awcms-repo-inventory`  | Regenerate `docs/awcms/repo-inventory.md` after adding a module/migration/table/test/route             | repo-inventory/SKILL.md        |

## Subagents (`.claude/agents/`)

Besides skills, **subagents** are available for delegating full pieces of work:

| Agent                    | Role                                                   | Tools     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `awcms-coder`            | End-to-end issue implementation (Master Prompt doc 12) | All       |
| `awcms-reviewer`         | Review a PR/diff against the DoD (read-only)           | Read-only |
| `awcms-security-auditor` | Module security audit, go-live verdict (read-only)     | Read-only |

Usage pattern: `awcms-coder` works the issue → `awcms-reviewer` reviews it → sensitive modules are audited by `awcms-security-auditor`.

## Conventions

- Skill name: `awcms-<area>`; folder `<name>/SKILL.md`.
- The frontmatter `description` carries the trigger (when to use it) so the model picks correctly.
- Skills reference `docs/awcms/*` as the source of truth rather than duplicating all of its contents.
