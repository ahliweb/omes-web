/**
 * Minimal TEST-SUPPORT example domain module. Illustrates realistic domain
 * module metadata (SoD rules, a business-scope capability, an OpenAPI
 * fragment, permissions/navigation/jobs) the reviewed base itself
 * deliberately never ships — used ONLY by tests to exercise base enforcement.
 * NOT part of the base registry: never imported by `src/modules/index.ts`,
 * only by `tests/fixtures/example-domain-modules/index.ts` and the tests that
 * compose it with `listBaseModules()`.
 *
 * Depends on two base modules (`tenant_admin`, `identity_access`) to prove the
 * composition rule engine validates a lifecycle dependency edge from a domain
 * module onto a base module. Provides the `example_crm_directory` capability
 * and consumes an OPTIONAL capability (`reporting_projection`) to exercise the
 * capability-binding checks without introducing a hard failure. `type` is
 * `"domain"` (awcms's `ModuleType` union is base/system/domain/integration,
 * matching the DB `awcms_modules_module_type_check` constraint).
