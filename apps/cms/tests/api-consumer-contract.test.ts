/**
 * ADR-0065 — the `awcms-astro` consumer contract, driven with planted specs.
 *
 * The live check passing proves nothing on its own: the fixture was generated
 * from the current bundle, so of course it matches. What must hold is that the
 * subset rule refuses the changes that break a consumer and accepts the ones
 * that do not — and that the closure reaches SCHEMAS, since a path object is a
 * few lines of `$ref` and every interesting breakage happens behind one.

/**
 * CONSUMED vs COMMITTED (assessment §9.5).
 *
 * The first version of this contract froze six paths because it was derived by
 * grepping the neighbour repo for `/api/v1/` **without stripping comments**.
 * Three of the six were prose: a type docblock, a comment explaining why the
 * build deliberately does NOT call `/auth/session`, and an error message
 * telling a human how to mint a credential.
 *
 * The neighbour has the authoritative answer and gates it —
 * `tests/kontrak-awcms.test.mjs` there asserts "the source calls exactly three
 * surfaces", comments removed first, bound two-ways to a marker block.
 *
 * These tests cannot read that repo. What they CAN do is make the two lists
 * unable to drift apart quietly: pin the count that the neighbour also pins, so
 * a fourth consumed surface here has to be a deliberate edit in both places.

    // If this fails, one of two things happened, and they need opposite fixes:
    //   - awcms-astro started (or stopped) calling a surface -> update both
    //     this list and the marker block in that repo, in the same change;
    //   - someone added a surface here that nobody calls -> it belongs in
    //     COMMITTED_PATHS with the ADR that promises it, or nowhere.
    //
    // The fourth arrived by exactly the route this split exists to make
    // possible: `/api/v1/site-profile/composed` was frozen as COMMITTED in
    // #645, BEFORE anything called it, and moved here once
    // `ahliweb/awcms-astro#61` made the call real. A promise and a dependency
    // both deserve stability and fail differently, and the distinction only
    // survives if entries actually move.
    //
    // `/api/v1/blog/terms` is the fifth and took the identical path: COMMITTED
    // in #650 with ADR-0104, moved here when `ahliweb/awcms-astro#66` built the
    // category and tag archives on it.
    //
    // The sixth and seventh, `/blog/menus` and `/blog/widgets`, took the same
    // path with one extra step in front of it: they could not be frozen at all
    // until #652 gave their responses an actual schema. Freezing an array of
    // bare `object` would have added a path to this list that no change could
    // ever break — a contract entry with no contract in it.
    //
    // The eighth and ninth, `/site-search/query` and `/suggest`, took the same
    // path (COMMITTED in #681 with ADR-0107, moved here when that repo published
    // its search box) and BROKE ITS PREMISE: they are not called by a build at
    // all. They run in the READER's browser, anonymously and cross-origin.
    //
    // That is invisible from here — both are `GET`s against this API, and the
    // neighbour's gate extracts string literals from `src/` without knowing who
    // executes them — so it is written down rather than left to be inferred. It
    // decides what breaking one costs: a shape change on the seven above reddens
    // a build somebody is watching, while a shape change on these two fails in a
    // stranger's browser, on a site published weeks ago that will not be rebuilt
    // on account of it.
    //
    // The tenth, `/analytics/collect`, is in that same reader-browser class and
    // breaks its rule again: it is the first consumed path that must carry a
    // HEADER. `security.checkOrigin` refuses a cross-origin POST whose content
    // type is form-like, so only `application/json` gets through — which is what
    // the `OPTIONS` handler from #637 exists for. Three reader-browser paths,
    // two opposite header rules, and no way to tell them apart from this side.
    //
    // The eleventh to thirteenth — the three `newsletter` paths — are the same
    // class again and break the rule that had held for all ten: they WRITE. A
    // subscription makes this deployment send mail to an address a stranger
    // typed, so a wrong shape does not blank a page, it sends something (or
    // silently stops sending it) to the person who asked.
    //
    // They also arrived by the intended route at its shortest: frozen as
    // COMMITTED in #748 on 27 August with ADR-0118, moved here on 28 August when
    // `ahliweb/awcms-astro`#90 shipped the form in its v0.4.0 — one day in the
    // promise block. That is the split working, not a formality skipped: the
    // caller was written FIRST and held behind a flag precisely because four
    // measured blockers in this repo made the endpoint unreachable, and it could
    // not be un-held until they were closed here.
