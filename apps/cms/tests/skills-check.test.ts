/**
 * `bun run skills:check` — the rules, driven with planted inputs.
 *
 * The live skill set passing proves almost nothing: it passes today by
 * construction, because it was made to. What has to be proven is that each rule
 * FAILS on the defect it exists for — and this repo has three recorded cases of
 * a gate that answered "clean" for something dirty, or dirty for something
 * clean, and then had its wrong answer written up as a decision.
 *
 * So every rule below is exercised through its pure helper with inputs the
 * current repo does not contain, and the two directions are asserted separately.
