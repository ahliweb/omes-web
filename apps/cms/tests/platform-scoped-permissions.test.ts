/**
 * PLATFORM-scoped permissions (ADR-0053): the code declaration, the migration
 * that seeds it, and the two places that must never hand one to a tenant.
 *
 * ## What this is defending
 *
 * `idn_admin_regions.dataset.configure`/`.restore` swap the region dataset
 * served to EVERY tenant. They first shipped as ordinary tenant permissions in
 * the global catalogue, which `bootstrapPlatformTenant` grants wholesale to a
 * new tenant's `owner` role — so an ordinary tenant owner held cross-tenant
 * authority, and nothing anywhere disagreed. ADR-0052 deleted them; ADR-0053
 * brings them back behind a scope.
 *
 * The regression that would undo it is small and reads like tidying up:
 * dropping `WHERE scope = 'tenant'` from the blanket grant, or removing
 * `scope: "platform"` from a descriptor because "the migration already says
 * so". Each is one line, and each restores the original defect in full.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.

/**
 * ADR-0089, Gelombang 8 PR 8.1 — the union has exactly two members, and a third
 * one is the specific proposal this block exists to refuse.
 *
 * `partner` is the value somebody will propose, because it reads as the obvious
 * way to say "this permission is a partner's". It is not: `scope` governs who
 * may HOLD a permission, partnership governs WHICH OBJECTS it touches. Merging
 * them yields a permission correctly held and executed against the WRONG
 * TENANT — and no RLS policy objects, because the actor really is authenticated
 * somewhere. Reach is modelled as DATA instead (`awcms_partners`,
 * `awcms_partner_managed_tenants`, `sql/116`).
 *
 * Source-pinned because the union is a TYPE: it does not exist at runtime, so
 * there is no value any behavioural test could inspect. Paired with an
 * existence assertion so a rename cannot make it pass vacuously — the
 * cross-wave rule the programme wrote after ADR-0063, where a mutation that
 * moved the RBAC check above the ABAC block left every test green.
