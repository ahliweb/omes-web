/**
 * Production server: the Bun process that serves this app's build, behind
 * whatever reverse proxy terminates TLS.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, and why it stays this short
 *
 * `@astrojs/node`'s standalone adapter already does the part that is
 * dangerous to reimplement: turning a request URL into a file under
 * `dist/client/` — traversal, double-encoding, symlinks are a solved
 * problem in the library it uses (`send`), and re-solving it here would
 * only add a second place that check could be wrong. What the adapter does
 * NOT do is set the security headers this app needs, or tell a hashed,
 * cacheable build asset apart from an HTML page that must always be
 * revalidated. Those two things, plus one hardcoded URL-continuity
 * redirect (`isProductsRedirect` below), are this file's whole job.
 *
 * No compression middleware here: a reverse proxy in front of this
 * container commonly already handles gzip/brotli, and a second compression
 * layer here would be scope this app was not asked to carry. `isProductsRedirect`
 * is one hardcoded rule for one URL this app itself used to serve, not the
 * generated `asal-pengalihan`-style redirect data file issue #5's file
 * checklist excludes; see that issue's "Scope amendment: match the live
 * site's URL shape" comment.
 *
 * Issue #24 adds two more small, self-contained jobs, both still read-only
 * against files `astro build` already wrote — neither reads an `AWCMS_*`
 * variable, so "a finished build never contacts awcms again" still holds:
 *
 *   - `/healthz` — reports the build id `scripts/write-build-id.mjs` wrote
 *     to `dist/client/build-id.txt` as part of `bun run build`, so an
 *     operator can tell which build a running container is actually
 *     serving without shelling in.
 *   - `Link: rel=preload` for every CSS file `astro build` emitted under
 *     `dist/client/_astro/`, on every non-asset (HTML) response — the
 *     browser can start fetching a page's stylesheet(s) the moment the
 *     response headers arrive, instead of waiting to parse far enough into
 *     `<head>` to find the `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag.
 *
 * Issue #28 adds a third: a legacy-URL redirect MAP this time (unlike
 * `isProductsRedirect`'s one hardcoded rule) — `readLegacyRedirectMap`/
 * `legacyRedirectLocation` below, read once at startup from a build-time
 * artifact (`src/profil/berita/pages/index/pengalihan-legacy.json.ts`), never per
 * request, so the same "no live awcms credential at runtime" invariant
 * holds for it too.
 *
 * Issue #55 (A9) adds a fourth, checked only when the third one misses:
 * `pengalihan-aturan.mjs`'s pure, table-driven rules for every OTHER
 * seputarborneo legacy shape (rubrik/daerah/mitra/video/static/search) —
 * see that file's own docblock for why those need no CMS row at all. Still
 * no I/O at request time: the table lives in that module's own source, and
 * the one thing it reads from outside itself (`context.legacyRedirects`,
 * the SAME map issue #28 already loaded at startup) is passed in, never
 * fetched again.
 *
 * Issue #75 adds a fifth, the LAST step before the adapter and the only
 * one that does not answer the request itself: an internal URL rewrite for
 * a page whose `.html` file the adapter cannot reach because a directory
 * of the same name sits beside it (`/berita` → `berita.html` next to
 * `berita/`) — `discoverShadowedHtmlPaths`/`shadowedHtmlUrl` below. Same
 * discipline as the other four: the set of such paths is read from
 * `dist/client/` once at startup, never per request.

 * Content-Security-Policy for this storefront.
 *
 * Every directive is `'self'` or `'none'` — with exactly ONE kind of
 * exemption, added by issue #27 and described below: the media origins
 * this build's own product photos live on.
 *
 * Until products had images (issue #23), this app referenced nothing
 * off-origin at all and the policy needed no exemption to justify. A
 * product photo changes that: `images[].publicUrl` is resolved by
 * `apps/cms` through `media_library` and points at that deployment's
 * public media origin (R2, a CDN, or the CMS host — a deployment's choice,
 * not this app's). Under a bare `img-src 'self'` the browser blocks it
 * silently, with the HTML correct and every gate green, and the reader
 * sees a broken page.
 *
 * Those origins are therefore DERIVED from the URLs the CMS actually sent
 * for this build (`src/lib/csp-asal-media.ts`, written to
 * `dist/client/csp.json` by `src/pages/csp.json.ts`) and read back here at
 * startup — not configured through an env variable that could disagree
 * with the content it protects. `CSP` below is the no-origin baseline, and
 * remains what a build with no images at all is served under.
 *
 * The one thing that would normally tempt an inline `style=""` or a
 * hand-written `<style>` block — coloring a product's label badge from its
 * CMS-supplied `labelColor` — is instead a build-time-generated EXTERNAL
 * stylesheet (`src/profil/toko/pages/product-labels.css.ts`), specifically so
 * `style-src 'self'` never needs `'unsafe-inline'`.

 * shape. Hardcoding them here, ungated by any data this build fetched, is
 * what makes that safe: nothing external ever influences these three
 * arrays. `GA_IMG_SRC` covers gtag.js's own image-transport FALLBACK (a
 * `<img>`/`Image()` beacon it falls back to when `fetch`/`sendBeacon` are

// berita/` (the articles), `video.html` beside `video/`, and `rubrik/
// <slug>.html` beside `rubrik/<slug>/` (the rubrik's `feed.xml` and
// `halaman/<n>.html`). `@astrojs/node`'s static handler
// (`node_modules/@astrojs/node/dist/serve-static.js`, v11.1.5) decides what
// to hand `send` from the DIRECTORY test first: for a directory-shaped
// request with no trailing slash under `trailingSlash: "never"` it rewrites
// the pathname to `<path>/index.html` — a file this build never writes —
// and only then calls `send`, whose `extensions: ["html"]` fallback (the
// thing that resolves `/kontak` to `kontak.html`) does not apply to a
// pathname that already ends in `.html`. `send` errors, the adapter falls
// through to SSR, and SSR has nothing prerendered at `/berita` either: 404,
// on a page whose file exists, with the build green.
//
// The fix is the smallest one that leaves the adapter's file serving
// untouched: when the request path is exactly one of those shadowed pages,
// rewrite `req.url` to `<path>.html` (query string preserved) BEFORE the
// adapter sees it. The rewritten path is no longer a directory, so the

// Which paths are shadowed is a fact about the build, not the request, so
// it is computed ONCE at startup by walking `dist/client/`
// (`discoverShadowedHtmlPaths`) and the per-request check is a `Set`
// lookup (`shadowedHtmlUrl`) — no `stat` per request, and no request-
// derived string ever touches the filesystem from this file. A path with a
// trailing slash (`/berita/`) is deliberately NOT rewritten: the adapter
// already 301s it to `/berita` (its own `trailingSlash: "never"` branch),
// and the redirected request is then rewritten here — one hop, as before.
//
// Not fixed at the source in `astro.config.mjs` because there is no
// setting that does it: `build.format: "directory"` would emit
// `berita/index.html` and cure the shadow, but also move EVERY page to
// `<slug>/index.html` and hand `trailingSlash: "never"` a directory-index
// rewrite on every request — the exact pairing that config's own `format`
// comment was written to avoid.
