/**
 * E2E browser test config (Playwright + Bun). See skill
 * `.claude/skills/awcms-browser-test/SKILL.md` for the full setup rationale,
 * conventions, and known Bun/Playwright gotchas. Ported from awcms-mini's
 * harness (mini-first flow, `docs/awcms/alur-pengembangan-mini-first.md`) and
 * adapted to this repo.
 *
 * Naming: specs use `*.e2e.ts` (not `.spec.ts`/`.test.ts`) so `bun test`'s own
 * recursive discovery — which matches `*.test.*`/`*_test.*`/`*.spec.*`/
 * `*_spec.*` by default — never picks these files up and tries to run them as
 * `bun:test` files (they use `@playwright/test`'s own `test`/`expect`, a
 * different runtime context entirely). Verify: `bun test tests/e2e` reports
 * "did not match any test files".
 *
 * This suite assumes an already-running app (`bun run dev` or `bun run
 * build && bun run start`, with `DATABASE_URL` set) at `E2E_BASE_URL` — the
 * same "you provide the environment" convention `tests/integration/*` uses for
 * `DATABASE_URL`. Playwright's own `webServer` auto-start is intentionally NOT
 * used: this app's server needs a live Postgres connection to boot at all,
 * which `webServer` has no way to provision.
