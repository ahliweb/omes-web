-- ADR-0039 (redirect-governance scope of seo_distribution) — permission catalog seed
-- for the `seo_distribution` redirect-management + 404-governance admin API
-- (`/api/v1/seo/redirects/*` and `/api/v1/seo/not-found/*`). Wires up the constants
-- in `seo-distribution/domain/seo-permissions.ts` and this module's `module.ts`
-- `permissions` declaration. Companion to sql/058 (the ADR-0038 config seed).
--
-- Same shape/limitation as every prior permission-seed migration here (sql/058,
-- sql/056, sql/054): this extends the global ABAC catalog only. Existing tenants'
-- `owner` role does NOT retroactively gain these — only tenants created after this
-- migration runs get them via `POST /api/v1/setup/initialize`. Backfilling existing
-- tenants is a separate operator concern, not silently done here.
--
-- ## Why read / create / update / delete are separate `redirect` actions
--
-- A redirect rule rewrites what a public URL resolves to — its blast radius is the
-- tenant's inbound-link/search surface. The four actions have distinct risk:
--   - `read`   — list/search rules, preview chains, and explain conflicts (low risk).
--                The privacy-minimized 404 governance data is a SEPARATE
--                `not_found.read` activity below, not part of `redirect.read`.
--   - `create` — add a rule / import in bulk / capture a URL change into a rule
--                (starts redirecting live traffic; idempotency-keyed + audited).
--   - `update` — edit / activate / deactivate / archive a rule, and change the
--                per-tenant redirect policy (legacy-blog toggle, auto-capture mode).
--   - `delete` — soft-delete / restore / purge a rule.
-- Keeping them separate lets a role audit or preview redirects without holding the
-- power to change what visitors are sent to.
--
-- `not_found` is its own activity (privacy-minimized broken-link governance):
--   - `read`   — view the 404 dashboard / top unresolved paths.
--   - `update` — mark an observation resolved / attach a suggested redirect / dismiss.
