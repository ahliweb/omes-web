/**
 * astro-script-typecheck.ts — `bun run check:astro-scripts:check`.
 *
 * Typechecks the `<script>` blocks inside `.astro` pages, which nothing else
 * in this repo does.
 *
 * ## The blind spot, and how it was found
 *
 * `bun run typecheck` is `tsc --noEmit`, and `tsc` cannot parse `.astro` at
 * all — the files are not in any program. `astro build` compiles the script
 * blocks with esbuild, which strips types without checking them. So every line
 * of client-side behaviour on 40-odd admin screens has been shipping
 * unchecked, and `AGENTS.md` already records `.astro` as the blind spot of
 * every type-based gate.
 *
 * That is not theoretical. Issue #552 refactored these scripts and found two
 * defects that a typechecker would have caught the day they landed:
 *
 * - `/admin/comments` and `/admin/blog-settings` both called
 *   `lockElement(button)` with the required `busyLabel` missing, so every
 *   moderation button read the literal string "undefined" while its request
 *   was in flight — and on `/admin/blog-settings` the same call threw outright
 *   when the button was absent, because `button` was typed `| null`.
 * - `/admin/blog-settings` rendered `result.message ?? "…"`, a property
 *   `sendJson` has never returned, so the fallback was the only message that
 *   could ever appear.
 *
 * ## How it works, and why the files land next to the page
 *
 * Each block is written to a sibling `*.astro-script-check.ts` in the SAME
 * directory as its page, then `tsc` runs over the project and the files are
 * deleted in a `finally`. Same directory is the whole trick: the imports in
 * these blocks are relative (`../../lib/ui/admin-form-client`), so a mirrored
 * tree elsewhere would need every specifier rewritten — a transformation that
 * can itself be wrong, and would then report errors that are not in the page.
 * Adjacent files resolve exactly what the page resolves.
 *
 * Blocks with no `import` are skipped: Astro inlines those, this app's CSP
 * blocks inline scripts, and a file with no imports is not a module — its
 * top-level `const`s would collide across pages in one program.
 *
 * ## Why stale files FAIL the check
 *
 * A previous run killed mid-flight leaves generated files behind, and those
 * are then typechecked against a page they may no longer match. Rather than
 * silently overwrite them, this refuses to start and names them: they are also
 * `.gitignore`d, so the alternative is a file that is invisible to git and
 * wrong.
