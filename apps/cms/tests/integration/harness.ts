/**
 * Integration-test harness — real PostgreSQL, real migrations, real route
 * handlers (Issue #154).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other file under `tests/` is a pure-unit test or a
 * migration-shape assertion; the handful that reach a database
 * (`workflow-approval-concurrency`, `reporting-projection-rebuild-lock`,
 * `office-directory-postgres`, `security-readiness-rls`) each open their OWN
 * `new Bun.SQL(DATABASE_URL)` connection. Nothing has ever proved that an
 * endpoint's real wiring (auth -> ABAC -> module-enabled -> transaction ->
 * RLS -> response envelope) holds, and — critically — nothing has ever proved
 * that RLS is ENFORCED rather than merely declared.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO DATABASES, AND WHY (this is the load-bearing design decision)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `bun test` runs every file in ONE process, and `src/lib/database/client.ts`
 * memoizes ONE `Bun.SQL` pool per client kind for that whole process, with no
 * eviction API. So `getDatabaseClient()` is pinned to whatever database it is
 * FIRST called against — in a full suite, that is `DATABASE_URL` (some earlier
 * file's route invocation memoizes it), and this harness cannot repoint it.
 * A naive "repoint `process.env.DATABASE_URL` at a throwaway database and hope
 * `getDatabaseClient()` picks it up" — which awcms-mini's harness does — is
 * therefore UNSOUND here and produced real cross-database split-brain (the
 * worker writing to database A while the seed went to database B). This
 * harness never mutates `process.env` and never assumes it owns the memoized
 * pool.
 *
 * Instead it exposes TWO clearly separated worlds:
 *
 * 1. THE EPHEMERAL DATABASE (`awcms_it_<pid>`) — built here from the supplied
 *    superuser `DATABASE_URL`, with a purpose-built NON-SUPERUSER owner role
 *    that RUNS the migrations (so it owns every table) and is then demoted,
 *    plus migration 019's least-privilege `awcms_app` activated. Reached ONLY
 *    through DEDICATED connections this harness owns
 *    (`getAdminSql`/`getOwnerSql`/`getAppRoleSql`/`getRuntimeSql`), never
 *    through `getDatabaseClient()`. This is where RLS/`FORCE` can actually be
 *    observed, because the connection is genuinely a non-superuser table
 *    owner (or the non-owner `awcms_app`). Tests that drive functions
 *    directly (passing `sql` in) live here: `db-role-separation`,
 *    `reporting-projections`.
 *
 * 2. THE HANDLER DATABASE — whatever `getDatabaseClient()` resolves to (i.e.
 *    the migrated `DATABASE_URL` database in CI). Route handlers call
 *    `getDatabaseClient()`/`getSetupDatabaseClient()` INTERNALLY, so a test
 *    that drives real HTTP handlers (`module-tenant-lifecycle`) has no choice
 *    but to run there. It seeds/reads/truncates through `getHandlerAdminSql()`
 *    — a superuser connection to THAT SAME database, discovered at runtime —
 *    so seed and handler never diverge. Its assertions are application-logic
 *    invariants (MODULE_DISABLED wiring, tenant-scoped session lookup, audit)
 *    that hold under any role; RLS ENFORCEMENT is proved rigorously in world
 *    1, not re-litigated here.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MIGRATIONS RUN AS A SUPERUSER OWNER, WHICH IS THEN DEMOTED
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ephemeral owner is created `SUPERUSER`, runs `bun scripts/db-migrate.ts`
 * (the real runner operators use, as a subprocess — never a reimplemented
 * apply loop), and is only THEN `ALTER`ed to `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS`. Not
 * harness convenience: migration 019 contains
 * `ALTER ROLE awcms_app SET app.current_tenant_id = '<all-zero uuid>'`, and
 * `ALTER ROLE ... SET` of a CUSTOMIZED (placeholder) GUC requires SUPERUSER —
 * `CREATEROLE` is not enough (`permission denied to set parameter
 * "app.current_tenant_id"`). Demoting afterwards leaves a non-superuser role
 * that genuinely owns the schema, the only way to observe `FORCE` at work.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * GATING — `DATABASE_URL`, deliberately, and nothing else
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `ci.yml`'s `quality` job runs `bun test` with NO Postgres service and no
 * `DATABASE_URL`, so `integrationEnabled` is false there and every suite
 * skips cleanly. Two pipelines DO provide a `postgres:18.4` service, set
 * `DATABASE_URL`, and migrate before executing this suite for real:
 * `ci.yml`'s dedicated `integration-tests` job (`bun test tests/integration/`
 * — scoped to exactly these 4 harness-based files, added alongside this
 * harness) and `release.yml`'s `validate` job (a separate, identically-scoped
 * step after `bun run check`). Gating on a bespoke variable of our own would
 * mean these tests run in NO pipeline while looking like coverage; that exact
 * mistake has already been made once in this repo (424 lines of inert
 * concurrency tests, PR #157). Do not "improve" this gate.
 *
 * The older, independent `*-postgres.test.ts`/concurrency files elsewhere
 * under `tests/` (each opening their own ad-hoc `DATABASE_URL` connection —
 * `office-directory-postgres`, `workflow-approval-concurrency`,
 * `keyset-pagination-precision-postgres`, `security-readiness-rls`,
 * `audit-log-purge`, `reporting-projection-rebuild-lock`) gate on the SAME
 * `DATABASE_URL` variable but were never designed to run concurrently against
 * one shared, already-migrated database in a single `bun test` process —
 * verified empirically (a bare `bun test` against a migrated DB collides, 26
 * failures). Neither pipeline runs a bare `bun test` against a migrated
 * database for that reason; both scope to `tests/integration/` explicitly.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LIFECYCLE — single-use database, cleaned up after
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * World-1 files call `setupIntegrationDatabase()` in `beforeAll` and
 * `teardownIntegrationDatabase()` in `afterAll` (ref-counted: the first
 * provisions role+database+schema, the last drops them). The database/role
 * names are `<pid>`-suffixed and STABLE per process — load-bearing, because a
 * later file in the same process re-acquires and a `Bun.SQL` pool transparently
 * reconnects after `DROP DATABASE ... WITH (FORCE)` + `CREATE DATABASE` of the
 * same name (verified empirically). `awcms_app` is cluster-scoped and created
 * by the real migration, so it is only de-LOGIN'd on teardown, never dropped.
 *
 * `bun test` fires neither `process.on("exit")` nor `"beforeExit"` (verified),
 * so `afterAll` is the only teardown hook — hence the ref-count.
