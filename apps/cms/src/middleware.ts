   * static content whose worst case at the edge is being cached for
   * `default_ttl` — no tenant is derivable from it. It would NOT be tolerable
   * for a path that varies by tenant or session, so a static file must never
   * become one.
   *
   * Security headers are a different matter and are NOT tolerable to skip:
   * `src/lib/server/standalone-entry.ts` applies the same
   * `buildSecurityHeaders()` to static responses before the adapter sees them.
