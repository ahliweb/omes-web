/**
 * The login lockout counter, under concurrency (Issue #483).
 *
 * ## Why this file has to exist at all
 *
 * Every lockout test in this repo before it was a DOMAIN test:
 * `tests/login-policy.test.ts` and `tests/login-env-parsing.test.ts` call
 * `evaluateLoginAttempt` directly and assert what it returns. Not one raised
 * `awcms_identities.failed_login_count` through the real route. So the suite was
 * green over a counter that two concurrent requests could hold at one — the
 * pure function was always right, and the route threw its answer away by
 * writing an absolute value computed from a separately-read row.
 *
 * That is the shape this file is built around: the assertion is about what
 * PostgreSQL ends up holding after K requests that OVERLAP, which is the one
 * thing no pure test can see.
 *
 * WORLD 2 (see harness.ts) — real handlers resolve `getDatabaseClient()`
 * internally, so this runs against the migrated `DATABASE_URL` database and
 * seeds/reads through a superuser connection to that same database.
 *
 * Skipped unless `DATABASE_URL` is set and carries the migrated schema.

 * `awcms_identities WHERE tenant_id = … AND login_identifier = …`, which is the

 * the counter moved. That is the "writer moved, readers did not" class, caught
