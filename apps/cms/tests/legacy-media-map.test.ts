/**
 * The legacy image handoff (Issue #599).
 *
 * ## What is at risk
 *
 * `renderGalleryBlockHtml` DROPS a gallery item whose media object does not
 * resolve — silently, by design, because a public page must degrade rather than
 * 500. That makes a wrong media object id the worst possible input to a bulk
 * import: the run reports success, the article looks imported, and its
 * photographs are gone. Nobody re-reads 23,906 articles.
 *
 * So the properties pinned here are about REFUSING, not about mapping:
 *
 * 1. A map that is not a flat `{ src: uuid }` object is refused as a whole.
 * 2. Every problem in it is reported, not just the first.
 * 3. `src` keys are matched LITERALLY — no trimming, no normalising — because
 *    a wrong match and a missing one have the same consequence, and only one of
 *    them is visible in a report.
 *
 * The registry check itself is not here: "is this a verified media object of
 * this tenant" is `isMediaReferenceSafe`, which needs a database, and
 * `tests/integration/legacy-import.integration.test.ts` is where that lives.
 *
 * Pure — no database.
