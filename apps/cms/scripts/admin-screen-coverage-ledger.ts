/**
 * Permissions that have no admin screen YET — a one-way ledger, not a register
 * of decisions.
 *
 * The difference is the whole point. `DELIBERATELY_UNSCREENED` in
 * `admin-screen-coverage-check.ts` says "an operator should not drive this from
 * a page", and each entry carries the reason. This list says nothing except
 * "nobody has built it". Mixing the two would let unfinished work acquire the
 * appearance of judgement, which is exactly how ADR-0058 found six exception
 * entries that were really six bugs.
 *
 * **It may only shrink.** Giving a permission a screen and leaving its line here
 * turns the gate RED, so the number below is always the real one. That property
 * is what makes it worth writing down at all: before this file, "13 of 21
 * modules have no screen" was a sentence somebody had to re-derive by hand, and
 * it was re-derived wrongly more than once.
 *
 * Adding a line is allowed — a new module lands with endpoints before screens —
 * but it is an edit somebody makes on purpose, in a file whose only content is
 * work not done.
 *
 * Ten modules. Two groups here were named as NOT cosmetic, and both have since
 * been built: every `email` suppression key (a suppressed address silently
 * stops receiving mail, including password resets, and nothing could list or
 * clear it from a page), and every `identity_access.business_scope_*` key
 * (assignment plus a maker/checker exception flow with no inbox for the
 * checker — #545 built the inbox, and found that the checker permission each
 * rule declares for itself was never enforced either).
 * `module_management.settings.*` was the one with a false alibi: three
 * documents claimed a generic `/admin/modules/{key}` settings panel existed,
 * and one used that claim to justify not building an editor. It never did —
 * until #546 built it, which is why those two keys are no longer on this list.
