/**
 * A cross-module import must be declared, or explicitly excused.
 *
 * ## This test was already assumed to exist
 *
 * `_shared/capability-contract-versions.ts` justifies version-less capability
 * strings by saying "a source-boundary test (`tests/unit/module-boundary.test.ts`)
 * is enough to keep provider and consumer in sync". **That file does not exist
 * in this repository.** The sentence was ported from awcms-mini along with the
 * registry; the test was not. So the stated safety net for the entire
 * capability model was imaginary, and the reference is fixed alongside this
 * file landing.
 *
 * ## What `modules:dag:check` cannot do
 *
 * That gate validates the DECLARED graph — self-dependency, duplicates, missing
 * keys, cycles — from `listModules()` alone, "tanpa I/O" by design. It never
 * reads a single import statement, so a module can import anything it likes as
 * long as it does not write it down. Seven such edges existed when this landed.
 *
 * The failure mode is not theoretical. `domain_event_runtime` imports
 * `reporting` while `reporting` declares `domain_event_runtime` as a
 * dependency: a genuine module-level cycle that the DAG gate reports as a valid
 * DAG, because the half that would close it was never declared. Declaring it
 * truthfully turns that gate red — which is exactly why it stayed undeclared,
 * and exactly why it needs to be written down somewhere that a reader will see.
 *
 * ## Three ways an edge can be legitimate
 *
 * 1. `dependencies` — a lifecycle ordering constraint.
 * 2. `capabilities.consumes[].providedBy` — a source-level relationship that
 *    deliberately does NOT imply ordering (the consumer degrades without it).
 * 3. `FOUNDATION_MODULES` / `DOCUMENTED_EXCEPTIONS` below, each with a reason.
 *
 * Type-only imports are NOT exempt. A type import is still a source-level
 * coupling to another module's shape, which is the thing being tracked; the
 * neutral-ground escape hatch for that is `_shared/ports/`, which this test
 * ignores entirely.

 * 1. `directory.replaceAll("-", "_")` — `src/modules/workflow-approval/`
 *    declares `key: "workflow"`, so every edge out of that directory resolved
 *    to a key absent from `listModules()`.
 * 2. Grepping `key: "..."` out of the source — four modules (`comments` among
 *    them) assign the key from a constant, so only 17 of 21 directories
 *    resolved and the other four were skipped entirely. `comments` had three
 *    undeclared imports at the time and the gate reported success.
