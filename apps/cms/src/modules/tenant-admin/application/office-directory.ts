/**
 * One keyset-paginated page of live offices, newest first.
 *
 * Ordering flipped from `created_at ASC` to newest-first (Issue #149): the
 * shared cursor helper compares `(created_at, id) < (cursor)`, so DESC is the
 * direction it encodes, and it is what every other paginated list here already
 * returns (workflow inbox, object sync queue). Callers that relied on
 * oldest-first must now page through or re-sort client-side; this is a
 * breaking read-order change, recorded as such in the changeset.
 *
 * The `id` tiebreaker is not decorative: `created_at` is not unique, and two
 * offices created in the same transaction share it exactly. Without the
 * tiebreaker in both the comparison and the ORDER BY, such rows would be
 * skipped or repeated across a page boundary.
 *
 * PRECISION (Issue #158): the cursor must round-trip `created_at` at the SAME
 * precision it is compared on, or the keyset silently loses rows. A JS `Date`
 * holds only milliseconds while `timestamptz` holds MICROSECONDS (the driver
 * floors them on the way out — `...:45.029058+00` arrives as `...:45.029Z`),
 * so a cursor built from a `Date` denotes an instant strictly EARLIER than
 * the row it came from and `(created_at, id) < (cursor)` would skip every row
 * sharing that millisecond. Measured before the fix: 105 offices → page 1
 * returned 100, page 2 returned 4; one office silently unreachable.
 *
 * The fix is central (`_shared/keyset-pagination.ts`): `created_at_cursor`
 * carries the FULL microsecond precision as UTC ISO-8601 text, the cursor
 * stores it verbatim, and the WHERE clause binds it back with `::timestamptz`.
 * This keeps `ORDER BY (created_at, id)` on the bare column — index-friendly
 * (`(tenant_id, created_at DESC)`) — instead of an expression the planner
 * might not match. This replaced an earlier local `date_trunc('milliseconds',
 * ...)` guard, removed here now that the shared helper carries microseconds.
