/**
 * blog-legacy-cutover-verify.ts — `bun run blog:legacy:cutover:verify`.
 *
 * Issue #599 scope item 4, and the only tool in the set that can fail the
 * Definition of Done's first half.
 *
 * ## SCOPE, amended 26 August 2026 (ADR-0116) — read this before the rest
 *
 * Everything below was written for a BULK migration, where every legacy URL was
 * obliged to resolve. That obligation is withdrawn: the archive is not migrated
 * wholesale, and the legacy site is a feature reference. An article that is
 * deliberately not imported is SUPPOSED to stop answering.
 *
 * Nothing in this file changes, because nothing in it was wrong — but the
 * question it answers is now set by the CORPUS you hand it, and the corpus is
 * no longer "every URL the legacy site ever published":
 *
 *  - Feed it the URLs of the rows actually imported — which
 *    `bun run blog:legacy:article-paths` emits — and every verdict below still
 *    means what it says.
 *  - Feed it the whole legacy site and it reports `no_rule` for each article
 *    left behind ON PURPOSE, i.e. the intended outcome as a failing one. That
 *    is not a defect in this job. `CutoverVerdict` has no member meaning
 *    "deliberately gone" and ADR-0116 deliberately did not add one, since no
 *    obligation now requires the full-corpus run that would need it.
 *
 * ## What the other two jobs structurally cannot see
 *
 * `blog:legacy:import` writes provenance; `blog:legacy:redirects:import`
 * derives one rule per imported post and proves those rules do not chain. Both
 * reason only about articles that were imported. A legacy URL that was NOT —
 * a deleted article, a paginated index, a tag page, a section feed — produces
 * no rule at all, and nothing in the pipeline notices. It answers 404 on
 * cutover day, and the ranking does not come back.
 *
 * That last sentence is the one the amendment above scopes. It is still exactly
 * right for a URL that was MEANT to move and silently did not — which is the
 * failure a selective import can still produce, one row at a time.
 *
 * This job starts from the other end: a corpus of the URLs the legacy site
 * actually published — its own sitemap (`--sitemap`), or a plain list of URLs
 * (`--urls`) when there is no sitemap to have. SeputarBorneo is the second case
 * and it is not exotic: no sitemap in the legacy tree, none in its git history,
 * and the live site 404s `/robots.txt` and every conventional sitemap path
 * while serving 200 itself. `--sitemap` always read a LOCAL FILE, so the
 * long-standing "needs the live sitemap" blocker on Issue #711 was only ever
 * the XML wrapper — a list assembled from a crawl, an access log, a Wayback CDX
 * export or the legacy database is the same evidence.
 *
 * ## It writes nothing
 *
 * There is no `--commit` because there is nothing to commit. Every other job in
 * this family defaults to a report and takes a flag to write; this one has no
 * write mode at all, which is why it is safe to run against production
 * repeatedly, and why it should be run again after the redirect import.
 *
 * ## It drives the real resolution path
 *
 * The chain walk is `resolveRedirectChain` with `findActiveRedirectByPath` as
 * its lookup — the same function pair the middleware uses on a live request —
 * and target liveness goes through whichever loader the destination's own route
 * calls: `fetchPublicBlogPostBySlug`, `fetchPublicBlogPageBySlug` or
 * `fetchPublicTermBySlug`, plus the `legacyTenantRouteEnabled` /
 * `rssEnabled` / `sitemapEnabled` settings each of those routes consults BEFORE
 * it looks anything up. A verifier that reimplements resolution proves that the
 * reimplementation agrees with the sitemap, which is not the question.
 *
 * The retired-`/news` family is applied in the SAME precedence the resolver
 * uses (ADR-0111): a tenant rule first, that rewrite only as a fallback. Before
 * that ADR the order was reversed, and it silently made every rule this job
 * checks unreachable.
 *
 * ## What a green run does NOT prove
 *
 * This job makes ZERO HTTP requests. It asks the database "is there a rule, and
 * is there a row at the end of it" — which is not the question "does the origin
 * a reader hits emit a 301". Every claim below is scoped to THIS deployment's
 * tables and THIS deployment's routes, and a green run is a partial claim by
 * construction.
 *
 * Two ways that gap has already bitten, both recorded in ADR-0114:
 *
 *  - **A different repo serves the target.** ADR-0113's 63 rubrik rules — over
 *    the 68 entries in `data/seputarborneo-legacy/rubrik-redirects.json`; count
 *    that file rather than trusting this comment — point at `/kategori/**`,
 *    which is served by `ahliweb/awcms-astro`, a separate `output: "static"`
 *    deployment with no middleware file at all. No lookup this job can make
 *    would ever notice. The 67 entries committed at the time were replayed
 *    against that repo's real built server and returned 404 with zero
 *    `Location` headers (the 68th was added afterwards and has not been
 *    replayed), while this job had nothing to say about it. That is why an
 *    unlookupable destination is now `target_unverifiable` and not `ok`.
 *
 *  - **A different LAYER serves the redirect.** ADR-0114 puts the SeputarBorneo
 *    legacy 301s at the EDGE (Coolify/Varnish), the only layer that can collapse
 *    `http→https` + `www→apex` + `legacy→new` into the one hop PRD §9.2 demands.
 *    `awcms_seo_redirects` — the only table this job reads — is applied at
 *    exactly one call site, `src/middleware.ts:341`, which those requests never
 *    reach. For that cutover a green run here says the DB agrees with itself,
 *    and says nothing whatsoever about what the edge is configured to send.
 *
 * Verifying the edge means requesting the legacy URLs over HTTP and reading the
 * `Location` headers that come back. That is a different tool, and this is not
 * it.
 *
 * ## Roles
 *
 * The APP role. It reads posts and redirect rules inside a tenant transaction;
 * `awcms_worker` has no reason to gain SELECT on either for a job run by hand.
