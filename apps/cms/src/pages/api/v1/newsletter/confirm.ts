/**
 * `POST /api/v1/newsletter/confirm` (Issue #598, ADR-0103) — anonymous.
 *
 * The moment consent is actually recorded. A row starts `pending` and carries no
 * consent timestamp; `consent_at` and `consent_ip_hash` are written HERE,
 * because what happened is that somebody followed a link from an inbox, not that
 * a form was submitted.
 *
 * ## The token is spent
 *
 * `confirmation_token_hash` is cleared on use. Keeping a used bearer credential
 * is keeping a credential, and this one confirms a subscription.
 *
 * ## Neutral, like its sibling
 *
 * A token that matches nothing, a token already spent, and a row in the wrong
 * state answer the same body as a successful confirmation. Distinguishing them
 * would let somebody holding a guessed token learn whether it was ever valid.
 * A MALFORMED token still answers 400 — that is a statement about the request.
 *
 * Rate-limited per IP: without it this is an oracle you can ask 10,000 times.
