/**
 * Issue #163 — real-PostgreSQL test that `checkWorkerSetupRoleGrants` verifies
 * the opt-in `awcms_worker`/`awcms_setup` roles hold EXACTLY their
 * least-privilege matrix, and fails in BOTH directions (under-grant ->
 * permission denied at runtime; over-grant -> isolation breach).
 *
 * Gated on `DATABASE_URL`, same convention as
 * `security-readiness-failclosed.test.ts`: `ci.yml`'s `quality` job has no
 * database so it skips cleanly; this actually executes in `ci.yml`'s
 * `integration-tests` job and `release.yml`'s `validate` job (both apply
 * `sql/022`, creating both roles, before this suite's dedicated
 * `bun test <legacy files>` step — run separately from the harness-based
 * `tests/integration/` suite; see `tests/integration/harness.ts` for why the
 * two collide if run together).
 *
 * The divergence cases INJECT a policy (not `mock.module`, which leaks across
 * files — PR #157) rather than mutating any grant: the real roles' grants are
 * never touched, so this test is safe to run against a shared cluster.
