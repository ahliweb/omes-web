/**
 * ADR-0036 media-library ownership inversion (adapting awcms-micro ADR-0026) —
 * this module OWNS the tenant media registry AND the capability every website
 * module consumes to use it.
 *
 * The registry moved here from `news_portal`: the presigned upload/finalize/
 * cancel flow, MIME sniffing, object-key derivation, R2 config + client,
 * verification, reconciliation, and the 9 media permissions
 * (`media_library.media.*`, migration `052`).
 *
 * `news_portal` no longer provides `news_media` — that capability is retired,
 * and `media_library` is `media-library-port.ts`'s sole provider
 * (`application/media-library-port-adapter.ts`, which imports only this module).
 * The coupling that used to keep media inside `news_portal` lived in the PORT
 * CONTRACT itself (`isFullOnlineR2ModeActiveForTenant`), so renaming the port
 * without splitting the contract would have inverted nothing.
 *
 * The split: "must this tenant's media references be registry-backed?" is a
 * MEDIA question, answered here from this module's own deployment readiness
 * (`domain/managed-media-readiness.ts`) and its own per-tenant flag
 * (`application/media-library-tenant-state.ts`, migration `053`), turned on by
 * `application/enable-managed-media-enforcement.ts` (`POST /api/v1/media/
 * enforcement`, migration `054`). That is what lets a brochure site have managed
 * media without switching on a news portal — the product gap this inversion was
 * written to close.
 *
 * `dependencies` excludes `blog_content` — today's only consumer, and since
 * ADR-0044 the owner of what `news_portal` used to hold — permanently, not
 * incidentally: media must never depend on its own consumers.
 *
 * PORT NOTES vs awcms-micro: this base ports the ownership inversion + the
 * enforcement-enable switch (micro step 5a). The media lifecycle/browser surface
 * (`/api/v1/media/objects/*`, `/admin/media`) SINCE LANDED here — ADR-0056 built
 * `/admin/media`, and `GET /api/v1/media/objects` resolves media references over
 * HTTP — so this module DOES declare `navigation` (see the entry ~40 lines
 * below, which contradicted this paragraph until 8 August 2026). Still absent:
 * the responsive `srcset` render path and the PDF media type, so the allowed
 * MIME set stays the four raster types.

    "Tenant-scoped media object registry and upload flow, reusable by every website module (ADR-0036, System Foundation). Owns `awcms_news_media_objects` (migrations 041/042/045) — a generic registry keyed by `module_key` with `owner_resource_type`/`owner_resource_id` references, direct-to-R2 presigned upload with real magic-byte MIME sniffing and server-side SHA-256 checksum verification, orphan lifecycle, and R2 reconciliation (the `news-media:reconcile` job). The table keeps its `news_media` name deliberately (ADR-0036 §3): it is referenced by three migrations and a hard composite FK from `awcms_news_portal_ad_placements`, so renaming would trade a cosmetic annoyance for real risk. Provides the `media_library` capability (`_shared/ports/media-library-port.ts`), whose sole consumer since ADR-0044 is `blog_content` — required, because the ad placements it absorbed from the retired `news_portal` module hold a real FK to a media object, while its post/page media handling no-ops for any tenant that has not switched enforcement on: media reference safety, resolution, and whether managed-media enforcement is active for a tenant (this module's own readiness plus its own per-tenant flag, migration 053) — so a brochure site gets managed media without a news portal. Turning that flag ON is a dedicated, readiness-gated, one-way switch (`POST /api/v1/media/enforcement`, migration 054). This module never transcodes bytes inside a DB transaction (ADR-0006), and is deliberately not a CDN, image proxy, or DAM. STILL ABSENT vs awcms-micro: responsive `srcset` render and the PDF media type. The media lifecycle/browser surface (`/api/v1/media/objects/*`, `/admin/media`) is NO LONGER absent — ADR-0056 built the admin screen and the object endpoints resolve media references over HTTP.",
