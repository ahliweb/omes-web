/**
 * No API request body is parsed before the caller's credential has been
 * checked — and the endpoints exempt from that are DECLARED, not discovered.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * `defineTenantRoute` checked only that a token was PRESENT, then ran the
 * route's `prepare` hook, which parses and validates the body. So a request
 * carrying any string at all as a bearer token — `Bearer nonsense` — reached
 * validation and came back with the endpoint's full schema:
 *
 *     POST /api/v1/blog/institutions   Authorization: Bearer nonsense
 *     → 400 {"code":"VALIDATION_ERROR","details":[
 *          {"field":"branch","message":"branch must be one of legislative, executive."},
 *          {"field":"name",  "message":"name is required and must be at most 150 characters."},
 *          {"field":"slug",  "message":"slug is required."}]}
 *
 * Measured against a running server: **77 session-gated endpoints** answered
 * that way. Three consequences, in ascending order of seriousness:
 *
 * 1. Field names, enum values and length limits are disclosed to an anonymous
 *    caller.
 * 2. JSON parsing and validation run for anyone, which is work an unauthenticated
 *    request should never cause (bounded by the body ceiling, so a nuisance
 *    rather than an amplifier).
 * 3. **Nothing is recorded.** `authorizeInTransaction` is what writes the
 *    decision log; a request that short-circuits before it leaves no trace. An
 *    attacker enumerating endpoints was invisible.
 *
 * ## Why a boundary in middleware rather than 77 route edits
 *
 * The per-route fix is real but has no mechanism behind it: nothing stops the
 * 78th route from reintroducing the same ordering, and 63 of the 77 are
 * hand-written handlers with no shared shape to fix. One boundary, crossed by
 * every API request, is a thing that can be reasoned about — and it turns
 * "which endpoints are reachable without a session", today implicit and
 * knowable only by reading 246 handlers, into the list below.
 *
 * The boundary does **authentication only**. Authorization stays with
 * `authorizeInTransaction` (ADR-0063) and is not duplicated here — a second
 * place deciding what a caller may DO is exactly the drift this repo has been
 * bitten by. This decides only whether the caller is anyone at all.
 *
 * ## Scope: bodies, not every request
 *
 * The rule is "authenticate before parsing a body", so it applies to methods
 * that carry one. A GET's query string is something the caller already knows,
 * and exempting reads keeps the cost — one session lookup — off the path an
 * admin UI takes most often.

 * Deliberately NOT here, though both were observed answering before checking a
 * session: `POST /api/v1/auth/sso/:providerKey/{link,unlink}`. They require a
 * token anyway — they answered `403 SSO_DISABLED` from a feature flag placed
