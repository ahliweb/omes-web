/**
 * No document or skill may claim a REGISTERED module is missing.
 *
 * ## What this caught
 *
 * Three live skills asserted that modules sitting in `listModules()` were not
 * in this base:
 *
 * - `awcms-data-lifecycle`: "`form_drafts`/`newsletter`/`comments` DITUNDA
 *   (modul belum di-port)". Both are ported; both are `delegated` adopters.
 *   The same skill claimed 2 adopters where there are 10 descriptors across 7
 *   modules — an agent following it would skip the legal-hold guard on tables
 *   that require it.
 * - `awcms-theming`: "`media_library` di-drop — belum ada di base".
 * - `awcms-wizard-form`: "modul `form_drafts` belum di-port".
 *
 * The theming one had a twin in the CODE (`src/modules/theming/presentation/theme-media.ts`),
 * which is how it stayed invisible: the seam returns an empty asset map and
 * its header explained that the media module does not exist. It does. Theme
 * logos silently never render, and the file said that was correct.
 *
 * ## Why a test
 *
 * These claims are load-bearing in a specific way: an agent reading a skill
 * that says a module is absent will not look for it, will not call it, and
 * will happily re-port or stub around something that already works. The drift
 * direction is always the same — prose freezes at the moment it was written
 * while the registry grows — so the claims rot silently and only in the
 * direction that causes wasted or duplicated work.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It does NOT try to validate every statement about a
 * module; it matches the specific Indonesian phrasings this repo uses for "not
 * ported / does not exist here" within a short window after a module key, and
 * lets a line off when it is visibly a correction or a historical note. A
 * broad "does this doc describe the module accurately" check is not
 * mechanizable; this one is, and it is the one that misled.
 *
 * No database, no network — runs in `quality` on every PR.
