# Part 18 — Configuration and Environment Reference

> **Status (2026-07-14):** the `awcms` repo is only at the re-foundation stage
> (see [ADR-0001](../adr/0001-rebuild-on-awcms-foundation-erp-scope.md)) —
> **no ERP module has been implemented yet**. This document is the
> **target standard/pattern** for foundation configuration (runtime, database,
> auth, sync, storage) that will apply once implementation starts — adapted
> from the [awcms-mini](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-mini) base which is
> already fully implemented, MINUS every env var specific to CMS features
> (blog/news portal, social publishing, public visitor analytics, news media
> R2) that is irrelevant to this repo's ERP scope. Env vars specific to ERP
> modules (finance, inventory, procurement, manufacturing, HR/payroll) and
> business integrations (payment gateway, marketplace, Coretax, logistics) DO
> NOT exist yet — they will be documented incrementally once those modules are
> actually built (see §ERP & business integrations — placeholder below), not
> written up front.

## Purpose

This document will complete the AWCMS foundation configuration reference: every
environment variable, optional feature flag, configuration precedence,
per-environment profiles, secret handling, and the offline/LAN-first deployment
topology that is the baseline of this ERP platform.

## Configuration principles

1. Every secret comes only from the **environment**, never from code/commits.
2. `.env` is ignored; `.env.example` holds placeholders only.
3. External providers (payment gateway, marketplace, tax/logistics, etc.) are
   **optional** behind a feature flag; off by default.
4. Core operations (e.g. transactions/bookkeeping) must not fail because a
   provider is off — graceful degradation (queue/pending), not hard failure.
5. Configuration is validated at boot; a missing required value stops the start
   with a clear message.
6. Soft delete is mandatory platform behaviour, not a feature flag;
   retention/purge is controlled by policy and workflow.
7. Runtime, build, and all tooling must be **Bun** (Bun-only); there is no
   `node` binary anywhere in the dev/build/deploy path.

## Runtime & tooling (Bun-only)

- **Runtime & package manager**: Bun (`packageManager: bun@x.y.z` pins the
  version). Every `package.json` script is invoked via `bun`/`bun run`; there is
  no `node`/`npm`/`npx`/`pnpm`/`yarn`.
- **Build/dev**: bins with a node shebang (astro/vite) are run with
  `bun --bun …` so they do not fall back to the `node` binary. Do not provide a
  `build:node` script variant.
- **Server**: native `Bun.serve`; if `@astrojs/node` (standalone) is used for
  SSR, the entry is run with `bun ./dist/standalone-entry.mjs` (the runtime is
  still Bun).
- **Database**: `Bun.sql` or `postgres` (postgres.js).
- **Deployment**: `deploy/systemd` `ExecStart` uses the `bun` path; the
  container image is based on `oven/bun` (not `node`). CI is Bun-only
  (setup-bun, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun test`,
  `bun --bun astro build`).
- **Allowed** (not a violation): importing `node:*` (Bun's built-in API) and
  `@types/*` in devDependencies — neither pulls in a Node.js runtime.

## Precedence

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Def[Code default] --> Env[Environment variable] --> Set[awcms_tenant_settings - per tenant/entity] --> Eff[Effective configuration]
```

- Runtime/secrets (DB, auth, sync HMAC, provider key): from the
  **environment**.
- Tenant/entity preferences (locale, timezone, theme): from **`awcms_tenants`**;
  display feature flags: from **`awcms_tenant_settings`**. Managed through
  `GET/PATCH /api/v1/settings` and the `/admin/settings` screen (target plan).
- Soft delete/purge retention may become a tenant policy, but it must never
  disable audit, RLS, or the default `deleted_at IS NULL` filter.

### Application core

| Var                         | Required | Default                 | Sensitive | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_ENV`                   | Yes      | `development`           | –         | development/test/production (`staging` REMOVED — ADR-0083)                                                                                                                                     |
| `APP_URL`                   | Yes      | `http://localhost:4321` | –         | Application base URL                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                 | –        | `info`                  | –         | `debug`/`info`/`warning`/`error`; `warn` is accepted as an alias for `warning` and logs a one-time notice (finding D3 — it used to validate, match no level, and silently fall back to `info`) |
| `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`  | –        | `730`                   | –         | Retention of `awcms_audit_events` (days), used by the audit log purge job                                                                                                                      |
| `FORM_DRAFT_RETENTION_DAYS` | –        | `30`                    | –         | Retention of `expired`/`abandoned` form drafts (days)                                                                                                                                          |

The default timezone/locale per tenant/entity is planned to come from data
(`awcms_tenants`/`awcms_tenant_settings`), not env vars — following the
awcms-mini pattern that deprecated `APP_TIMEZONE`/`APP_DEFAULT_LOCALE` as env
vars because their effective value always comes from the DB per tenant.

### Database & pool

| Var                             | Required | Default                           | Sensitive | Purpose                                                                                                                     |

| `AWCMS_APP_DB_PASSWORD`         | –        | –                                 | Yes       | Password of the `awcms_app` role used by the container init script; must match the password in `DATABASE_URL`               |
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`             | –        | `20`                              | –         | Max pool connections (kind `app`; also the default for `worker`/`setup` unless overridden)                                  |

| `DATABASE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | –        | `15000`                           | –         | Statement timeout                                                                                                           |

| `SETUP_DATABASE_URL`            | –        | falls back to `DATABASE_URL`      | Yes       | Separate connection + pool for `POST /api/v1/setup/initialize`. Opt-in to the `awcms_setup` role (sql/022)                  |

#### Database role model

What **actually exists** in this repo (Issue #141, #160, #163) is **four**
roles: the migration owner, `awcms_app`, and — opt-in —
`awcms_worker`/`awcms_setup`.

1. **Migration owner** (superuser/owner) — used by `bun run db:migrate` only.
   The only role that can `ALTER`/`DROP`/`CREATE`/`GRANT`. The runner reads the
   **same** env var (`DATABASE_URL`), so run migrations with that var overridden
   to the owner's connection string, not `awcms_app`.
2. **`awcms_app`** ("web runtime", `DATABASE_URL`) — serves every HTTP request
   and every background job. Created by
   `sql/019_awcms_db_role_separation.sql`: not a superuser, not BYPASSRLS, not
   a table owner, DML only (no DDL). That is where RLS finally becomes a real
   security boundary: `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` (migration 017) closes the
   table-owner bypass, but SUPERUSER/BYPASSRLS walks past RLS regardless of
   FORCE — so both halves must be present, and before 019 that was **not** the
   case.
   It is created NOLOGIN without a password; a deployment activates it once with
   `ALTER ROLE awcms_app LOGIN PASSWORD '<secret>';` (the password never enters
   a migration).
   The fail-closed default GUC `app.current_tenant_id =
'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'` is set on this role as well:
   a query touching an RLS table outside `withTenant()` gets **zero rows**, not
   an `unrecognized configuration parameter` error and not another tenant's
   data.

Narrowing of global table grants (Issue #160,
`sql/021_awcms_db_role_grants_narrow.sql`): on **global tables without RLS**,
`awcms_app` **no longer** holds the excess DML that was residual #159 — it is
now **read-only** on `awcms_permissions` (the permission catalogue, seeded only
by migrations) and `awcms_schema_migrations` (the migration ledger, written only
by `db:migrate` as owner), and it **cannot `DELETE`** from `awcms_tenants` or
`awcms_setup_state`. What is **deliberately kept** because the `awcms_app` code
path genuinely uses it: `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`SELECT` on `awcms_tenants` (INSERT
through the setup wizard that falls back to the `awcms_app` connection; UPDATE
through the tenant-settings screen) and `awcms_setup_state` (singleton lock via
the setup path), plus full DML on the module-registry tables (`awcms_modules` +
its descendants) written at request time by module-management. Regressions (a
new global table swept up in blanket DML from default privileges, or a new
tenant-scoped table that is RLS-forced but **ungranted** → `permission denied`)
are caught by the `security:readiness` check "Runtime role table grants match
least-privilege matrix".

3. **`awcms_worker`** ("background worker", `WORKER_DATABASE_URL`) and
4. **`awcms_setup`** ("bootstrap/setup", `SETUP_DATABASE_URL`) — created by
   `sql/022_awcms_db_worker_setup_roles.sql` (Issue #163, the second half of the
   mini-045 role split; the first half = narrowing `awcms_app` in sql/021).
   `awcms_worker` serves seven cron workers (audit purge, object/email/
   domain-event/workflow/reporting dispatch), `awcms_setup` serves the
   `POST /api/v1/setup/initialize` bootstrap. Each holds only the
   per-write-path GRANTs its code actually uses (traced per script in THIS
   repo, not copied from mini — mini's visitor-analytics/blog/form-drafts
   worker set does not exist here), with **zero** access to the global
   catalogues it does not touch (`awcms_permissions`,
   `awcms_schema_migrations`, `awcms_setup_state`, the module registry).
   Neither is superuser/BYPASSRLS/owner, both carry the same fail-closed default
   GUC as `awcms_app`, and both are NOLOGIN without a password until a
   deployment activates them.

**OPT-IN, not breaking.** `getWorkerDatabaseClient`/`getSetupDatabaseClient`
(`src/lib/database/client.ts`) still fall back to `DATABASE_URL` (the
`awcms_app` connection) when `WORKER_DATABASE_URL`/`SETUP_DATABASE_URL` are
empty — a deployment that manages a single connection string keeps working
unchanged, and the roles simply sit there unused until a URL is pointed at them.
The benefit of opting in: **pool isolation** (a slow job does not exhaust the
connections serving HTTP,
`DATABASE_POOL_MAX_WORKER`/`DATABASE_POOL_MAX_SETUP`) **plus real
least-privilege role isolation**. The honest consequence of this optional
design: isolating `awcms_app` from `awcms_tenants`/`awcms_setup_state` is only
**complete** once `SETUP_DATABASE_URL` points at `awcms_setup` — until then the
setup wizard still runs its INSERT/UPDATE as `awcms_app` through the fallback
path (exactly why sql/021 kept `awcms_app`'s INSERT/UPDATE on both of those
tables).

Grant regressions for BOTH role layers are caught by the `security:readiness`
check: a new global table swept into blanket DML or a new tenant-scoped table
ungranted on `awcms_app` by "Runtime role table grants match least-privilege
matrix"; and `awcms_worker`/`awcms_setup` that — when provisioned — are
under/over-granted relative to their matrix by "Worker/setup least-privilege
role grants match matrix" (non-blocking when the role is not yet provisioned:
the default fallback). Compared with the state before 019 (everything through a
superuser), this is a firm layered improvement.

#### Deployment-aware capacity (target)

The plan is the same cross-instance connection capacity model as awcms-mini —
per-process pool/work-class versus the PostgreSQL/PgBouncer capacity approved
for the whole fleet of instances, validated through the
`database:capacity:check` command before go-live.

The defaults above are meant to be safe for a single-instance LAN-first
topology without PgBouncer. Raise the instance MAX vars only when you genuinely
scale out horizontally.

### Full-online auth security hardening (optional, target)

A shared gate for online-only features: Cloudflare Turnstile, MFA/TOTP, Google
OIDC login, generic tenant OIDC SSO, and the admin policy UI. It is **not** a
replacement for the `APP_ENV=production` deployment model — an offline/LAN
deployment is planned to be operationally production-grade without ever needing
these online-only features.

- `AUTH_ONLINE_SECURITY_ENABLED` unset (or not `"true"`) → every online-only
  hardening feature is considered off; no provider credential of any kind is
  required. This is the default for every offline/LAN deployment.
- `AUTH_ONLINE_SECURITY_ENABLED=true` requires
  `AUTH_ONLINE_SECURITY_PROFILE=full_online` — any other value (including an
  explicitly contradictory `"disabled"`) is planned to fail `config:validate`.
- The plan is one centralised helper (the `isFullOnlineSecurityActive(env)`
  pattern) that every online/provider-related feature must call before doing
  anything online/provider-related — do not re-derive the "both must agree"
  rule anywhere else.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — planned to be validated independently of the gate
  above, but runtime activation requires BOTH (gate ∧ `TURNSTILE_ENABLED=true`).
  It applies to `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/password/forgot`,
  `/auth/password/reset`, `/setup/initialize` — the token is verified
  server-side against Cloudflare siteverify BEFORE the expensive password/DB
  work. Verification is fail-closed by design; only a genuine transport failure
  to Cloudflare opens its circuit breaker — a normal `success:false` response
  (the client token really is wrong) does not trip the breaker.
- **MFA/TOTP** — `AUTH_MFA_ENABLED` is planned to be validated independently of
  the gate above, but runtime activation requires BOTH. MFA is **opt-in per
  identity**, not mandatory tenant-wide. The TOTP secret is encrypted at rest
  (AES-256-GCM, `AUTH_MFA_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) — the only application secret
  that is reversibly encrypted rather than hashed, because it must be
  recomputable to verify a code. Recovery codes are stored hash-only. A
  password reset does NOT disable MFA.
- **Google OIDC login** — the provider account is linked via `sub` (the OIDC
  subject), NEVER via email — auto-link by email only happens when
  `email_verified` is true AND its domain is in `AUTH_GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`
  (empty = auto-link is always refused, fail-closed). The ID token is fully
  cryptographically verified (signature, issuer, audience, expiry, nonce).
- **Generic tenant OIDC SSO** — a PARALLEL path for tenant-configured providers
  (Okta, Azure AD, Keycloak, etc.), separate from Google OIDC login. The
  provider's client secret is either AES-256-GCM encrypted OR an env-var
  reference — exactly one, never both, and never plaintext in any API response.
  **Break-glass enforcement**: `sso_required=true` or
  `password_login_enabled=false` cannot be saved unless at least one break-glass
  identity is currently active — re-checked from the DB at SAVE time and at
  readiness/go-live time.
- **Admin policy UI** — shows a status summary of every feature above; in every
  offline/LAN/local deployment (the default) the page only shows read-only
  information, without any form or table.

### Request body size limits (target)

Planned as code constants (not env vars) — deliberately not made configurable
so that no deployment can silently loosen the hard ceiling without a code
review. Every `/api/*` handler that accepts a body reads through the
`readJsonBody`/`readTextBody`/`readFormBody` helpers (replacing direct
`request.json()`/`.text()`/`.formData()`) — enforcing the declared
`Content-Length` BEFORE any byte is read, plus streaming byte counting for
chunked bodies/bodies without a `Content-Length`. The planned tiers:
`default` (128 KiB, the majority of CRUD/settings/auth endpoints),
`large` (5 MiB, content-heavy/batch endpoints — e.g. finance/inventory data
import, `sync/push`/`sync/objects` batches). The hard ceiling is 10 MiB — no
tier may exceed it. An oversized body is always `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`.

### Sync & node

| Var                       | Required | Default | Sensitive | Purpose                                                                                                        |

| `SYNC_HMAC_ALLOW_LEGACY`  | –        | `true`  | –         | Accept v1 signatures (not bound to tenant/node, vulnerable to GHSA-c972); set `false` once every node sends v2 |

Node identity is planned to come from the `awcms_sync_nodes` table (DB),
registered automatically through the header/HMAC on the first sync request —
not a separate env var (following the awcms-mini finding that deprecated
`AWCMS_MINI_NODE_ID` because no code ever read it).

| `OBJECT_SYNC_LOCAL_ROOT_PATH`   | –        | `./var/object-sync` | –         | The only directory the object-sync dispatcher may read a queued object from; a node's `localPath` is relative to it and cannot leave it |

Local filesystem storage (`STORAGE_DRIVER`/`LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH`) is
deliberately not made a separate env var — following the awcms-mini finding
that the local/R2 switch really only needs one flag (`R2_ENABLED`).

### Edge cache / Varnish (ADR-0042)

An OPTIONAL cache tier in front of the application
(`src/lib/edge-cache/config.ts`,
[`edge-cache-architecture.md`](edge-cache-architecture.md)). None of these
variables is set by default, and not being set means the subsystem is
**genuinely inert** — no surrogate header, no invalidation, no behavioural
change. Turning it on is a two-sided change: the application is configured here
AND a Varnish container is put in front
(`infra/varnish/docker-compose.varnish.yml`).

The most expensive misconfiguration is not the one that turns boot red: an
endpoint without a token (invalidation fails silently, stale content forever)
and a `MAX_TTL` raised without noticing (one careless declaration pins stale
content at the edge) — both are checked by
`config:validate`/`security:readiness`, not guessed at.

### Email (notifications — target)

Planned as a reusable base module for password reset, system announcements, and
workflow notifications (e.g. finance/procurement approvals needing multi-level
sign-off) — provider-neutral.

| Var                      | Required   | Default | Sensitive | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EMAIL_ENABLED`          | –          | `false` | –         | Enable the email module                                    |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER`         | if enabled | –       | –         | Email provider adapter (`log` for dev without credentials) |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`     | if enabled | –       | –         | Default sender address                                     |
| `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`        | –          | `AWCMS` | –         | Default sender name                                        |
| `EMAIL_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS`  | –          | `10000` | –         | Timeout for a single send attempt (dispatcher)             |
| `EMAIL_SEND_MAX_RETRIES` | –          | `5`     | –         | Retry attempt limit before a final `failed`                |

Concrete email provider credentials (e.g. `EMAIL_<PROVIDER>_API_TOKEN`) are
added once that provider adapter is actually implemented — they are not
registered up front.

### Data lifecycle (target)

Planned as a System Foundation module for a cross-module registry of
high-volume tables and a lifecycle engine (retention/partitioning/archive/legal
hold/safe purge) — relevant for high-volume ERP finance/transaction data with
long-term retention/audit obligations.

| Var                                | Required | Default                        | Sensitive | Purpose                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATA_LIFECYCLE_ARCHIVE_ROOT_PATH` | –        | `./var/data-lifecycle-archive` | –         | Filesystem root where the local/offline archive adapter writes its artifacts |

### ERP & business integrations — placeholder

There are no env vars specific to ERP modules (finance/accounting, inventory/
warehouse, procurement, manufacturing, HR/payroll) or to external business
integrations (payment gateway, marketplace, tax/Coretax, logistics provider) in
this repo — **no module has been implemented yet** (see the status above).

As those modules start being built, their env vars will be documented here
following the same pattern as every other section above: an `*_ENABLED` flag
defaulting to `false`, credentials only from the environment/a secret manager
(never a tenant-controlled DB column unless there is an explicitly documented
accepted risk), a circuit breaker + timeout per provider, graceful degradation
when a provider is off (the transaction is still recorded, synchronisation to
the provider is deferred — not a total failure), and cross-field validation
through `config:validate`/`security:readiness`. See
[`templates/module-proposal-template.md`](templates/module-proposal-template.md)
and
[`templates/module-admission-decision-checklist.md`](templates/module-admission-decision-checklist.md)
for the admission process for a new module, including the checklist specific to
external providers.

## Feature flag

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Boot[Boot] --> Val[Env validation]
  Val --> Flags{Feature flags}
  Flags -->|R2 off| L[Local storage]
  Flags -->|EMAIL_ENABLED off| Q0[Email module - outbox waits, dispatcher does not run]
  Flags -->|Sync off| LanOnly[LAN-only]
  Flags -->|External ERP provider off| Q1[Transaction still recorded - synchronisation to the provider deferred]
```

Rule: a feature being off does not stop core operations (recording
transactions); messages/objects/documents still enter the queue and wait for
the feature to be enabled.

## Per-environment profiles

| Environment         | Characteristics                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| development         | All providers off, local DB, cookie not secure                                                             |
| production (online) | HTTPS, secret manager, tested backup+restore, sync optional                                                |
| **offline/LAN**     | No internet; sync/R2/external providers off or deferred; core operations still fully running; local backup |

Three, not four: `staging` was removed from the deployment profile vocabulary
([ADR-0083](../adr/0083-this-template-deploys-to-one-environment.md)
as amended). Its isolation contract did not disappear with it — it applies to
any second environment someone stands up, and is written down in
[`environments.md`](environments.md) §Second-environment isolation contract.
`test` is still an accepted `APP_ENV` value for automated test execution; that
is not a deployment profile.

## LAN-first deployment topology

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph LAN["Office / Warehouse / LAN"]
    P1[Operational Application 1]
    P2[Operational Application 2]
    A1[Admin]
    Srv[AWCMS - Bun/Astro]
    DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    Bak[Local backup]
    Srv --- DB
    Srv --- Bak
    P1 --- Srv
    P2 --- Srv
    A1 --- Srv
  end
  Srv -. when online .-> Cloud[(Central server / R2 / external ERP provider)]
```

- One LAN server runs the application + PostgreSQL; clients connect over the
  local network.
- External providers & sync only when online; core operations do not depend on
  them.
- Deployment: `deploy/systemd`, `deploy/nginx`, `deploy/pgbouncer`,
  `deploy/backup` (planned, following the awcms-mini pattern).

## Configuration validation at boot

- A missing required var → fail to start with a clear message (without leaking
  the value).
- A flag enabled without credentials (e.g. `R2_ENABLED=true` without a key) →
  fail to start.
- Secrets never enter logs (redaction).

## Acceptance criteria (target)

- Boot validates the env; a missing required var stops the start with a safe message.
- A provider being off does not stop core operations; messages/objects/documents enter the queue.
- Secrets come only from the env; none in code/commits/logs/responses.
- Tenant preferences (locale/theme) come from `awcms_tenants`, not hardcoded.
- The offline/LAN profile runs fully without internet.
