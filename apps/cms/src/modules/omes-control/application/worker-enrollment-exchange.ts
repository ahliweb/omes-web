/**
 * Worker-side enrollment redemption, `POST /api/v1/omes/worker/enroll`
 * (ahliweb/omes#199). Pairs with `application/enrollment-management.ts`
 * (#198), which mints the challenge an OPERATOR issues; this file is where
 * the WORKER redeems it.
 *
 * ## Genuinely single-use redemption
 *
 * `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the exact row, inside the caller's transaction,
 * THEN an `UPDATE` of that same locked row in the same transaction. This is
 * real DB-level compare-and-set, not a read-then-write race in application
 * code: a second, concurrent redemption attempt's own `SELECT ... FOR
 * UPDATE` blocks on the first transaction's row lock until that transaction
 * commits or rolls back, then re-reads the now-committed row — under READ
 * COMMITTED (Postgres's default, and what `withTenant` uses) a blocked
 * locking read re-fetches the latest committed version once unblocked. So
 * the loser always observes `status <> 'pending'` and is refused; there is
 * no window where both readers see `pending`.
 * `tests/integration/omes-control-worker.integration.test.ts`'s
 * `challenge redemption is genuinely single-use under a real race` exercises
 * this with two concurrent connections and asserts on the row count in
 * `awcms_omes_enrollments` with `status = 'enrolled'` for the worker (must
 * be exactly one), not merely on the HTTP status the loser received.
 *
 * ## Proof of possession
 *
 * The presented `public_key` is only trusted once the worker demonstrates it
 * controls the matching private key: `enrollmentSignatureBase64` must verify
 * as a valid Ed25519 signature, under that same public key, over the raw
 * `enrollment_challenge` string. Without this, an on-path attacker who
 * observes (but cannot itself redeem) a challenge value could not enroll a
 * public key of its own choosing merely by relaying the challenge — it would
 * also need the private key it claims to hold, which by construction it does
 * not have if this is the legitimate worker's freshly generated keypair.
