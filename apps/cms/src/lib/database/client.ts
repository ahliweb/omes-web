 * drift from it. `worker`/`setup` each fall back to the shared

 * this preserves the exact pre-#743 behavior (every kind used the same
 * `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` number) for every deployment that has not opted into
 * per-kind sizing. Tries, in order: the kind's own override var (if
 * defined AND valid) -> `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` (if valid) -> the hardcoded
 * `DEFAULT_POOL_MAX` — an INVALID override (non-finite/non-positive/
 * non-integer) falls through to the next tier rather than jumping straight
 * to the hardcoded default, so a malformed `DATABASE_POOL_MAX_WORKER`
 * doesn't discard an otherwise-valid, deliberately-set `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`.
 * Never throws — a malformed override must never prevent the process from
 * starting; `bun run config:validate`/`database:capacity:check` are where
 * operators are told about a bad value, not the pool constructor.

/**
 * Issue 10.2 pool config. `Bun.SQL` itself only understands a flat
 * connection pool (`max`); it has no notion of "work class" — that
 * concurrency gate lives in `work-class.ts` and sits in front of this
 * client. This module only wires:
 *
 * - `max` — pool size, from `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` (doc 16 §Connection pooling),
 *   optionally overridden per kind (`resolvePoolMaxForKind` above, Issue
 *   #743) via `DATABASE_POOL_MAX_WORKER`/`DATABASE_POOL_MAX_SETUP`.
 * - `prepare` — disabled when `DATABASE_PGBOUNCER=true`, since automatic
 *   prepared statements are unsafe/ineffective behind PgBouncer transaction
 *   mode (doc 16, `docs/awcms/database-pooling.md`).
 * - `connection.statement_timeout` — sets the session-level
 *   `statement_timeout` GUC on every new pooled connection. NOTE: per
 *   `node_modules/bun-types/sql.d.ts`, `onconnect` on `Bun.SQL.Options` is
 *   typed `(err: Error | null) => void` — it only reports connect
 *   success/failure, it does not hand back a client to run SQL against (the
 *   `onconnect: (client) => ...` shown in that same file's own JSDoc example
 *   is inconsistent with the actual signature). The documented, type-correct
 *   way to apply a per-connection session GUC like `statement_timeout` is
 *   the `connection` option ("Postgres client runtime configuration
 *   options", see postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html),
 *   which Bun applies to every pooled connection at connect time. `onconnect`
 *   is still used below, only to log connection failures.

 * ROLE MAPPING — what this repo actually ships (Issues #141, #160, #163;
 * `tests/db-role-separation-migration.test.ts` fails if any migration path
 * cited here stops existing):
 *
 * - `app` -> `DATABASE_URL` -> role `awcms_app`, created by
 *   `sql/019_awcms_db_role_separation.sql` (NOLOGIN + passwordless there;
 *   deployment activates LOGIN + a secret and points `DATABASE_URL` at it —
 *   doc 18 §Model role database). Not superuser, not BYPASSRLS, not the
 *   tables' owner, so RLS is genuinely enforced against it, with a
 *   fail-closed default `app.current_tenant_id` GUC as the backstop. Its
 *   blanket DML on the RLS-free global tables was narrowed by
 *   `sql/021_awcms_db_role_grants_narrow.sql` (Issue #160): it can no longer
 *   DELETE `awcms_tenants`, DELETE `awcms_schema_migrations`, or write
 *   `awcms_permissions`.
 * - `worker` -> `WORKER_DATABASE_URL` -> role `awcms_worker`, `setup` ->
 *   `SETUP_DATABASE_URL` -> role `awcms_setup`, both created by
 *   `sql/022_awcms_db_worker_setup_roles.sql` (Issue #163 — the second half
 *   of the mini-045 role split; the first half was sql/021's `awcms_app`
 *   narrowing). Each holds ONLY the per-write-path grants its scripts use:
 *   `awcms_worker` for the seven unattended cron jobs (audit purge, object/
 *   email/domain-event/workflow/reporting dispatch), `awcms_setup` for the
 *   one-time `POST /api/v1/setup/initialize` bootstrap. Like `awcms_app`,
 *   both ship NOLOGIN + passwordless; a deployment OPTS IN by activating
 *   LOGIN and pointing the URL at the role.
 *   OPT-IN, NOT breaking: when `WORKER_DATABASE_URL`/`SETUP_DATABASE_URL` are
 *   unset, both fall back to `DATABASE_URL` (the `awcms_app` connection) —
 *   the supported default, so a deployment that manages one connection string
 *   keeps working unchanged and the roles simply sit unused. The isolation
 *   benefit is real only once an operator configures the dedicated URL (see
 *   sql/022's header for the uneven-by-design trade-off this implies for
 *   `awcms_tenants`/`awcms_setup_state` under the setup-fallback path).
 *
 * Each kind gets its OWN lazily-created, memoized `Bun.SQL` pool — never
 * shared across kinds, even when they resolve to the same URL by fallback
 * (simpler than trying to dedupe pools by URL, and pool-per-kind is cheap:
 * `Bun.SQL` pools are lazy, an unused one opens zero connections). So the
 * seams give per-kind pool sizing (`resolvePoolMaxForKind`) AND, when opted
 * in, real least-privilege role isolation — keeping a slow background job
 * from exhausting the pool serving HTTP requests either way.
