/**
 * `site_search` — Official Optional Module admitted by ADR-0040 (ported from
 * awcms-micro Issue #270, epic #261 Wave 2). Admission + first runtime code land
 * together in this PR.
 *
 * ## What this module OWNS
 *
 * A tenant-scoped, cross-content PostgreSQL full-text search index (projection)
 * over PUBLISHED website content — `awcms_site_search_documents` (sql/064, RLS
 * FORCE'd, `tsvector`/GIN + `pg_trgm` on title for suggestions) — plus its tenant
 * config (`awcms_site_search_settings`), run ledger
 * (`awcms_site_search_index_runs`), failed-item diagnostics
 * (`awcms_site_search_index_failures`), and opt-in minimized query log
 * (`awcms_site_search_query_log`). It serves the public `/search` page + bounded
 * JSON `/api/v1/site-search/query` and `/suggest` endpoints, and the admin
 * index/settings/diagnostics API.
 *
 * ## Direction of the arrow (ADR-0040 §2) — depends on nothing but Core
 *
 * `site_search` is the CONSUMER/aggregator: content modules PROVIDE reviewed,
 * pure-data `SearchSourceDescriptor`s via `ModuleDescriptor.searchSources`
 * (declarative table/column mapping + publication filter — never an executable
 * extractor), which this module's generic engine reads through `listModules()`.
 * It does NOT declare a `search_source` capability `provides` (that would trip
 * `capability_provider_conflict` with >1 content-module provider) — the
 * descriptor-list riding `listModules()` is the multi-provider seam
 * (`reporting`/`data_lifecycle` precedent). No existing module depends on
 * `site_search`, and its lifecycle `dependencies` are ONLY the two Core modules,
 * so the DAG is intact.
 *
 * ## Security spine (ADR-0040 threat model)
 *
 * Publication-state is enforced at the source→index boundary (the index holds
 * public content only; it is NEVER an authorization source); every query is
 * tenant + locale scoped (RLS FORCE + explicit predicates + tenant-first cache
 * key); the query text is always a bound parameter into `websearch_to_tsquery`
 * (SQL injection impossible); snippets are `ts_headline` sentinels escaped in
 * `renderSafeSnippet` (XSS impossible); anonymous search has per-IP rate limits,
 * query-length bounds, and result caps.
 *
 * ## Admin surface
 *
 * `navigation` points at `/admin/site-search` — the operations console: index
 * status/freshness, documents by resource type, recent runs, reconcile/rebuild,
 * the settings form, and failed-item diagnostics. The entry and the page landed
 * in the SAME change, which is the invariant
 * `tests/admin-navigation-registry.test.ts` enforces in both directions (a nav
 * entry with no page is a permanent 404 in the menu; a page no descriptor claims
 * is unreachable).
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT here yet
 *
 * `capabilities` is undeclared (the search-source seam is
 * the descriptor list, not a capability). `events` stays undeclared: index
 * lifecycle events (`awcms.site-search.*`) are documented log lines, not yet
 * published through `domain_event_runtime`. Indexing blog PAGES (no public route
 * in this base) and media metadata is a follow-up — the descriptor seam already
 * supports them.

    "Tenant-scoped, cross-content PostgreSQL full-text search over PUBLISHED website content (ADR-0040, ported from awcms-micro Issue #270). Owns the unified search index `awcms_site_search_documents` (sql/064 — RLS FORCE'd, `tsvector`/GIN + `pg_trgm` title index for suggestions), per-tenant config `awcms_site_search_settings`, the index run ledger, failed-item diagnostics, and an opt-in minimized query log. It is the CONSUMER/aggregator of reviewed, pure-data `SearchSourceDescriptor`s that content modules declare via `ModuleDescriptor.searchSources` (declarative table/column mapping + declarative publication filter — never an executable extractor or tenant SQL); the generic engine reads them through `listModules()`, so any content module is indexed without this module knowing a specific one and without a content module depending on `site_search`. An event-shaped incremental reindex primitive (`reindexSearchResource`) plus a deterministic, idempotent reconcile/rebuild (`site-search:reconcile`) keep the index a faithful projection: archive/delete/unpublish removes content from public results with no stale leakage, and reconciliation matches source counts/checksums. The public `/search` page + bounded JSON `/api/v1/site-search/query` and `/suggest` endpoints are host-resolved and tenant + locale scoped (RLS FORCE + explicit predicates + tenant-first cache key), query text is always a bound parameter into `websearch_to_tsquery('simple', $1)` (SQL injection impossible), snippets are `ts_headline` sentinels escaped before any HTML is emitted (XSS impossible), and anonymous search is rate-limited, length-bounded, and result-capped. The admin API under `/api/v1/site-search/*` (index status/rebuild/reconcile, settings, diagnostics) is ABAC-guarded, audited, idempotency-keyed, and observable. Public URLs are built from each descriptor's `urlTemplate` with a server-resolved `:tenantCode` — this base's public content routes are path-tenant-scoped (`/blog/{tenantCode}/{slug}`, ADR-0009) rather than awcms-micro's host-resolved `/news/:slug`. PORT-TIME DROP (documented, not silent): awcms-micro's inline suggestion-typeahead script on the `/search` page is not ported — this base's CSP forbids inline scripts and its public pages are plain APIRoute HTML with no bundling step, so the page ships the no-JS core search and `/suggest` remains available to a theme's own bundled client. The search index is a projection of public content only and is NEVER an authorization source.",
  // See `seo_distribution` for the same reasoning: the public `/search` route
  // gates on `fetchTenantModuleEntry`, so `module_management` is a genuine
  // lifecycle dependency that was imported without being declared.
