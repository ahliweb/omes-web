#!/usr/bin/env bun
/**
 * Bumps the version, folds the waiting changesets into CHANGELOG.md, and
 * tags a release `vX.Y.Z`.
 *
 * Writing release notes is the task most easily postponed until it is
 * forgotten. This script moves the mechanical part (compute the version,
 * merge the files, cut the tag) to the machine — and, by reading `bump`
 * from each changeset (see `packages/gerbang/lib/changeset.mjs`), it moves
 * one more thing: **the size of the release**. What is left for a human is
 * judging one change while writing it — not judging ten at once, months
 * later, from a list of file names.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run release                  # preview only; level derived from changesets
 *   bun run release --apply          # write package.json + CHANGELOG.md
 *   bun run release --apply --commit # also commit and tag
 *   bun run release minor --apply    # raise ABOVE what the changesets demand
 *
 * The level named on the command line is optional, and may only be LARGER
 * than what the changesets demand. A smaller one is refused: that would
 * publish a change that breaks something behind a number promising it does
 * not.
 *
 * Without --apply the script only reports. Without --commit the files are
 * written but the commit and tag are left to a human; the exact commands
 * are printed.
