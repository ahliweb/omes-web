/**
 * `/admin/reporting` gates against the endpoints it drives.
 *
 * Sibling of `admin-data-lifecycle-page-contract.test.ts`, for the same silent
 * failure: a page gating on a permission key no migration seeds hides the
 * section from everyone — including the owner — while still looking like a
 * working screen with an empty area. This repo has shipped that bug twice, both
 * times by inventing a plausible action name.
 *
 * `reporting` is an unusually good place to repeat it. Its seven permissions
 * span three activity codes and four non-CRUD actions (`rebuild`, `analyze`,
 * `configure`, `export`), and the natural guesses are all wrong in the same
 * direction:
 *
 * - cancelling a rebuild reads like `projections.cancel` — the endpoint
 *   enforces `projections.rebuild`;
 * - reconciling reads like `projections.read` (it only compares numbers) — the
 *   endpoint enforces `projections.analyze`;
 * - triggering an export reads like `exports.configure` (it is an operator
 *   action on a schedule's projection) — the endpoint enforces
 *   `exports.export`.
 *
 * Each of those would render a control that denies every caller.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
