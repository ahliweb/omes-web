/**
 * The two authorization facts about the grant behind a delegated actor: is the

 * ADR-0090 (expiry) and ADR-0093 (suspension).
 *
 * A SEPARATE call from `resolveDelegatedGrantId`, and deliberately so: that one
 * resolves an ATTRIBUTION and is documented as fail-quiet, because nothing is
 * permitted or refused because of it. This one IS an authorization input, and
 * mixing the two would give a fail-quiet resolver a decision to make.
 *
 * ## `expires_at > now()` is the gate ADR-0090 promised
 *
 * ADR-0090 says revocation **and expiry** deactivate the membership in the same
 * transaction. Revocation had an executor; expiry never did, so until this
 * predicate existed a grant scoped "until 30 September" kept conferring its role
 * for as long as nobody revoked it by hand. The sweep
 * (`identity-access:delegated-access:expiry`) is CLEANUP — it ends the session
 * and the membership — and this predicate is the gate: expiry takes effect at
 * the instant on the row, not at the instant a timer next fires.
 *
 * `now()` is the transaction start instant, so every decision inside one request
 * reads the same clock, and it is the DATABASE's clock — the same one that wrote
 * `expires_at`. Comparing it against an application `Date` would make the gate
 * depend on two clocks agreeing.
 *
 * ## Why one query for two facts
 *
 * They come off the same row. A second round trip would buy nothing, and the
 * caller needs both before it can name the refusal correctly — an expired grant
 * recorded as `partner_suspended` puts a false fact in the decision log.
 *
 * `awcms_partners` belongs to the PLATFORM tenant and is `FORCE ROW LEVEL
 * SECURITY`; this runs in the CUSTOMER's transaction and cannot read it. The
 * narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` function from `sql/124` answers the one question —
 * a `text`, never a row — with the four `sql/048` safeguards and the same
 * memberless NOLOGIN owner `sql/119` created.
 *
 * For a NON-delegated actor this returns `{ grantLive: true, status: null }`:
 * there is no grant to be past its date and no partner to ask about, and the
 * two deny rules both look at `principalKind` before they look at either field,
 * so an ordinary member's decision is exactly where it was.
 *
 * For a delegated actor with no matching row BOTH fields say refuse. That is
 * unreachable (`sql/120`'s foreign key keeps the partner registered, and
 * `sql/117`'s pairing constraint keeps a redeemed grant's tenant user set), and
 * it is because it is unreachable that fail-closed costs nothing.

 *
 * When `requiredEntitlementKey` is `null` — which is every request in this base,
 * because no module declares `requiresEntitlement` — this issues literally the
 * statement `resolveModuleEnabled` issues and returns `entitlementHeld: true`.
 * Not "an equivalent statement": the same one, so the wave's inertness is a
 * property of the code rather than a claim about it, and
 * `tests/entitlement-guard-chain.test.ts` asserts the emitted SQL is identical.
 *
 * ## Why a LEFT JOIN and not a second await
 *
 * The chokepoint runs on every guarded request. A second round trip for a
 * question whose answer is "nothing was required" 100% of the time would be a
 * permanent cost bought for a feature nobody enabled. The entitlement half is
 * folded into the `awcms_tenant_modules` read that already happens, so a
 * deployment that DOES sell something pays one query for both answers and a
 * deployment that does not pays nothing at all.
 *
 * ## The union, and why it is resolved live
 *
 * A tenant holds an entitlement when EITHER a direct grant in
 * `awcms_tenant_entitlements` is live (no expiry, or an expiry in the future),
 * OR its EFFECTIVE plan contains the key. Both halves are read at request time;
 * nothing is materialized. A cached effective set would mean a downgrade takes
 * effect on the next refresh, and the gap between those two moments is exactly
 * when someone still reaches what they stopped paying for.
 *
 * ## No subscription row means the DEFAULT plan (ADR-0084, PR 5.4)
 *
 * The same convention `awcms_tenant_modules` has used since `sql/008`: a missing
 * row is not a decision, it is the absence of one, and the absence must read as
 * the baseline the operator declared rather than as a refusal. An installation
 * that never touches subscriptions therefore behaves exactly as it did before
 * entitlements existed — which is the only acceptable default for a template.
 *
 * It also removed a defect the ownership gate caught: provisioning used to
 * INSERT a subscription at tenant birth, making `awcms_tenant_subscriptions`
 * a table written by BOTH `tenant_admin` and `identity_access` — an ADR-0013 §6
 * shared-table write. Deriving the default instead of writing it leaves exactly
 * one writer (the ladder job) and needs no cross-tenant backfill at all.
 *
 * The fallback is deliberately NOT applied when a subscription row EXISTS but is
 * not in an entitling status. That case is a suspension, and falling back to the
 * default plan there would quietly undo it — the `CASE ... THEN NULL` is what
 * distinguishes "never subscribed" from "subscribed and lapsed".
 *
 * `now` is the request timestamp already threaded through the guard, not
 * `now()`: a CHECK or a comparison that mixes the application clock with the
 * transaction clock is the trap `postgres now() = transaction start` records,
 * and expiry that lands on a transaction boundary would read differently to the
 * two halves of the same decision.

 * copied every `awcms_access_assignments` row into `awcms_access_policies`
 * keeping its `id`, then revoked write privileges on the old table, so a live
 * grant now has exactly one home. The union had to go in the SAME change,

 * granting forever).
 *
 * The join itself lives in `grant-source.ts` and is shared with every other
 * reader, which is the actual fix ADR-0079 records: five readers had drifted
 * onto the abandoned table and each one was wrong in a different, silent way.
 *
 * ## Why the return type has NOT changed yet
 *
 * The program plan has this returning `{ keys, scopes }`, because scope-qualified
 * evaluation (PR 3.4) needs the map. It stays a `Set<string>` here: shipping a

 * that consumes it.

 * The NAME must not change. `scripts/access-chokepoint-check.ts:149` keys its
 * "this handler decides permissions" signal on the literal
 * `fetchGrantedPermissionKeys(`, so a rename leaves that gate green while it
 * reports zero deciding handlers — which is why the gate also asserts the count
 * is non-zero.
 *
 * ## What is filtered where
 *
 * Lifecycle (`status`, effective dating) is filtered by the shared fragment, at
 * the database's transaction clock. Soft-deleted roles are dropped here, because
 * `r.deleted_at` belongs to the role rather than to the grant — a deleted role is
 * exactly what an admin deletes in order to take access away, and it must stop
 * granting even while the grant row survives.
