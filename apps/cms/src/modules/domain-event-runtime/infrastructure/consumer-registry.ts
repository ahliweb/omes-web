/**
 * Two representative consumers ("provide at least two representative
 * consumers: one same-process cross-module consumer; one reporting/
 * read-model projection consumer or test fixture"), both registered against
 * `SAMPLE_RECORDED_EVENT_TYPE` — the same self-contained reference event
 * `event-type-registry.ts` documents. Real producer/consumer modules
 * register their OWN entries here when they start using this runtime
 * (deliberately not done for any existing module in this foundation
 * module).
 *
 * Port note (from awcms-mini): the awcms-mini registry also carries two
 * later-wave consumers projecting into `reporting` and `integration_hub`.
 * **That note is now only half true and the half that changed matters.**
 * `integration_hub` is still absent, so its consumer is still not ported.
 * `reporting` EXISTS, and a third consumer below (see
 * `eventActivityProjectorConsumer`) does import it — lines 8-9 of this file.
 *
 * The first two consumers below remain fully self-contained: the audit
 * projector calls `logging`'s public `recordAuditEvent`, and the
 * activity-rollup projector writes only this module's own
 * `awcms_domain_event_activity_daily` table.
 *
 * ## The import direction is worth knowing before you add a fourth
 *
 * `reporting`'s descriptor declares `domain_event_runtime` as a dependency,
 * while this file imports `reporting`. At MODULE level that is a cycle. It is
 * invisible to `bun run modules:dag:check`, which validates declared
 * dependencies only (`listModules()`, no I/O by design) and therefore cannot
 * see an import that was never declared — and declaring this one truthfully
 * would make that gate fail with a cycle. There is no FILE-level cycle:
 * `reporting` mentions this module only in comments and descriptor strings.
 *
 * Do not "fix" this by adding `reporting` to this module's `dependencies`
 * without deciding the real question first: whether a runtime-level module
 * should know a reporting module at all, or whether this consumer belongs in
 * a composition root outside both.
