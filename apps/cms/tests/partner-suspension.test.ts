/**
 * A suspended partner stops reaching in — ADR-0093, Issue #543.
 *
 * `sql/116` pinned `awcms_partners.status` to `'active'` with a CHECK and wrote
 * its own condition into the file header: the widening lands in the SAME PR as
 * its reader, or not at all. Shipping a partner that CAN be suspended before
 * anything READS suspension is a control that reads as enforced and is not —
 * the shape `sql/106` used for `scope_type`.
 *
 * These tests hold the three readers to that, and they check the two things a
 * decision rule can get wrong in the direction that matters:
 *
 * - **deny-only.** An ordinary member's decision must be untouched, whatever
 *   the registry says.
 * - **fail-closed.** A delegated actor whose partner has no registry row is
 *   treated as suspended, and an in-statement predicate is what makes the two
 *   write paths refuse — never a TypeScript check that precedes the INSERT.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. The SQL assertions read the statements as
 * source, which is the only way to pin "the predicate is INSIDE the statement"
 * at all: a behavioural test is satisfied by both the correct arrangement and
 * the TOCTOU one.
