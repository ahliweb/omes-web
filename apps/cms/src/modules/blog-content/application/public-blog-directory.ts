/**
 * Public (anonymous) read queries for `awcms_blog_posts` (Issue

 * `tenant_id = $1` predicate (the caller connects via the least-privilege
 * app role with RLS FORCE'd — same defense-in-depth convention as every
 * other tenant-scoped query in this repo) and a public-visibility
 * predicate — never the admin `blog-post-directory.ts` functions, which
 * assume an authenticated+authorized caller.
 *
 * Two distinct predicates, both from doc issue #540:
 * - **Listing** (index/category/tag archive/feed/sitemap):
 *   `status = 'published' AND visibility = 'public' AND deleted_at IS NULL
 *   AND published_at IS NOT NULL AND published_at <= now()` — the exact
 *   predicate #539's `searchPublicBlogContent` already implements.
 * - **Detail** (single post by slug): same, but `visibility IN ('public',
 *   'unlisted')` — doc issue #540's acceptance criteria explicitly scope
 *   the unlisted exclusion to "listing/search/feed/sitemap" only, meaning
 *   an unlisted post *is* reachable by direct link (that is the entire
 *   point of the "unlisted" tier existing separately from "private",
 *   which is never publicly reachable at all).
