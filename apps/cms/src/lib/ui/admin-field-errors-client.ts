/**
 * The FORM half of `admin-form-client.ts`: the same same-origin cookie-auth
 * JSON mutation, plus the `error.details` array `sendJson` deliberately drops.
 *
 * Kept in its own module for the same CSP reason every helper here exists (an
 * imported `<script>` bundles to an external `/_astro/*.js`; an import-free one
 * is inlined and blocked), and split from `sendJson` along a real seam:
 * `sendJson` serves BUTTONS — publish, archive, purge — where the only useful
 * answer is "it failed, try again" and a field name would be meaningless. This
 * serves FORMS, where the operator can fix exactly one named field and cannot
 * fix anything if the screen will not say which.
 *
 * ## The defect that made it necessary
 *
 * `/admin/blog`'s create form answered every failure with "Check the title and
 * slug, then try again" while the field the API had actually rejected was
 * `contentText`. Advice pointing at the two fields that were CORRECT is worse
 * than no advice: it sends the author round a loop that cannot terminate,
 * which is precisely what happened — the form was unusable for months and the
 * message blamed the wrong thing the whole time.
 *
 * ## What is surfaced, and what is not
 *
 * Only the field NAMES, mapped through the caller's own label map. The
 * server's message string is never echoed, so the "generic copy only — never
 * surface internal detail" rule every other admin screen follows still holds:
 * an unknown field falls back to its own key, which is a name the form chose,
 * not a sentence the server wrote.
