/**
 * Job-queue promotion and leasing for `POST /api/v1/omes/worker/poll`
 * (ahliweb/omes#199).
 *
 * `operation-submission.ts` (#198) only ever leaves an allowlisted operation
 * as an `awcms_omes_operation_requests` row with `status = 'approved'` — its
 * own header says the pull worker is "the only reader that turns an approved
 * row into real host work" but #198 never itself wrote an
 * `awcms_omes_jobs` row. This file is that promotion: it is the first thing
 * IN THIS ISSUE'S scope that makes an approved operation request pollable at
 * all, so a poll response can ever carry `status: "job_available"`.
 *
 * Both steps run in the caller's transaction and are each individually
 * concurrency-safe:
 *   1. `promoteNextApprovedOperation` — `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claims at
 *      most one not-yet-promoted `approved` operation_request for this
 *      tenant+server, and inserts exactly one `awcms_omes_jobs` row for it.
 *      The `awcms_omes_jobs_operation_request_unique_idx` partial unique
 *      index (sql/159) is the DB-level backstop if two application
 *      processes ever raced past the `SKIP LOCKED` claim (they cannot, on
 *      one Postgres instance, but this is not this module's only future
 *      deployment topology).
 *   2. `leaseNextQueuedJob` — the same `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` pattern
 *      leases the oldest `queued` job for this tenant+server to this poll's
 *      worker identity, so two concurrent pollers for the SAME server never
 *      lease the same job (each `SKIP LOCKED`s past whatever the other
 *      already claimed).
