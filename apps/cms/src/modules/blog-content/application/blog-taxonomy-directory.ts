 * generates one archive page per tag then generates a hundred pages, and every
 * article filed under a later tag links to a page that was never built.
 *
 * Ordering by `created_at` rather than `name` is not a preference. A term can
 * be renamed at any time, and a rename moves it across a page boundary — so a
 * cursor over `name` skips or repeats terms and neither side can tell.
 * `created_at` is immutable, which is the whole reason it is the key here and
 * in `listBlogPostsPage`.

 *
 * ## Why automatic tag linking gets its own query
 *
 * It used to call `listBlogTerms(tx, tenantId, { taxonomyType: "tag" })`, whose
 * bound was chosen for an admin table: `ORDER BY name ASC`, a hundred rows. On
 * a tenant with more than a hundred tags that silently reduced the feature to
 * the alphabetically-first hundred — so whether a tag ever got linked was
 * decided by its first letter, and nothing anywhere said so. An editor asking
 * "why was `Sepak Bola` not linked?" got no answer: the tag exists, it is
 * enabled, it is spelled correctly, and it happens to start with S.
 *
 * ## Why a bound still exists
 *
 * `createInternalTagLinkEngine` compiles ONE alternation regex from every
 * candidate. Handing it several thousand literals means a very large regex
 * compiled on a public post render, so removing the bound is not the fix. The
 * defect was that the bound was inherited by accident, degraded alphabetically,
 * and was invisible.
 *
 * All three are addressed: the bound is named and lives with the feature
 * (`MAX_INTERNAL_TAG_LINK_CANDIDATES`), the ordering is by how many posts
 * actually carry the tag — the tags most likely to occur in prose — and the
 * caller learns whether it was hit.
 *
 * Assignments to soft-deleted posts are excluded, so a tag left on five hundred
 * deleted articles does not outrank one in daily use.
