 * Cross-origin policy for the anonymous storefront commerce endpoints

 * verbatim — the storefront-endpoints contract states plainly that this
 * family follows "the same cross-origin pattern awcms already hardened for
 * newsletter, search and comments." See that file's own header for the full
 * "what was actually broken" history this repeats rather than relitigates:
 * an unanswered preflight, an unreadable answer with no
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and a tenant resolved from the wrong thing
 * (the request HOST, which for a statically built storefront is always this
 * CMS, never the shopper's own site).
 *
 * ## Never `*`, `Vary: Origin` on every response, no credentials
 *
 * Same three rules, same reasons, as `newsletter-cors.ts`. This surface
 * additionally never sets `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` — no route
 * under `/api/v1/commerce/storefront/*` reads or sets a cookie; every
 * "session" here is a `(orderCode, phone)` pair or a client-generated
 * `idempotencyKey`, carried in the request body/query, never a cookie.

 * The account routes (`otp/request`, `otp/verify`, `me`, `logout`) pass
 * `["content-type", "authorization"]` so a bearer request's preflight is
 * actually answered — omitting `authorization` here would make every
 * cross-origin `Authorization: Bearer …` call fail the preflight before the
 * browser ever sends it, no matter what the route itself accepts. Still no
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` anywhere in this family (see this
 * file's own header) — a bearer token is a capability the browser attaches
 * explicitly, never a cookie the browser would send automatically.
 *
 * `PUT`/`DELETE` joined `GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS` with Issue #91's account
 * resource routes (`PUT .../account/wishlist`,
 * `DELETE .../account/addresses/{id}`/`.../wishlist/{productId}`) — listed
 * for every route in this family rather than varying per route, since the
 * method list is a preflight-level policy, not a per-endpoint one, and a
 * wider allow-list here costs nothing: an actual route still answers
 * `405`/404 on a method it does not implement.
