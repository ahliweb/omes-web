/**
 * Which tenant holds PLATFORM authority, and whether this deployment is
 * currently single- or multi-tenant.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * A handful of actions in this base change data that is served to EVERY tenant
 * — the Indonesia region dataset being the first (ADR-0046/ADR-0052). Those
 * actions have no sensible per-tenant subject: the tables carry no `tenant_id`
 * and no RLS, so "the tenant asking" is not the population affected.
 *
 * ADR-0051 §Keputusan made the rule normative — an action whose effect crosses
 * tenant boundaries MUST have a platform-scoped gate and MUST NOT sit in the
 * catalogue seeded to tenant roles — but the primitive that rule needs did not
 * exist. This is that primitive's first half: naming the tenant that holds
 * platform authority. The second half is `scope: "platform"` on the permission
 * itself (`_shared/module-contract.ts`) and the chokepoint check in
 * `identity-access/application/access-guard.ts`.
 *
 * ## The resolution order, and why it starts where it does
 *
 * `PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` → the public default-tenant chain
 * (`PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` → `PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TENANT_CODE` →
 * `awcms_setup_state.tenant_id`).
 *
 * The default is deliberately the SAME chain the public renderer uses, because
 * in a single-tenant deployment those are the same tenant and inventing a
 * second answer would be a second thing to keep in step. `PLATFORM_TENANT_ID`
 * exists so the two can be separated the day they stop agreeing — in SaaS the
 * landing page usually belongs to a marketing tenant while platform authority
 * must stay with the operator — WITHOUT another migration or another change to
 * the authorization chokepoint.
 *
 * **Operational consequence, stated rather than buried:** while
 * `PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` is unset, `PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` is a security
 * control. Repointing it repoints platform authority. `security:readiness`
 * reports which tenant currently holds that authority and warns when it is not
 * the tenant the setup wizard bootstrapped, so the condition is visible rather
 * than silent.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed asymmetry against the public resolver
 *
 * `resolveDefaultPublicTenantFromEnv` treats a malformed/unknown
 * `PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` as "this step did not resolve" and falls through:
 * for RENDERING, degrading to the next candidate is graceful. For AUTHORITY it
 * is not — falling through would hand platform rights to a tenant the operator
 * did not name. So an explicitly-set-but-unresolvable `PLATFORM_TENANT_ID`
 * resolves to `null` here, and `null` denies every platform action.

/**
 * The platform tenant's id, IGNORING its status — Issue #429, ADR-0073.
 *
 * `resolvePlatformTenant` deliberately requires `status = 'active'`, so that
 * "nobody is the platform" can never read as "everybody is" for
 * platform-scoped permissions. That is right for AUTHORITY and wrong for the
 * suspension exemption, and the difference matters:
 *
 * If the platform tenant is ever marked non-active — a bad restore, an
 * operator mistake, or (once entitlements land) a lapsed subscription — then
 * `resolvePlatformTenant` returns `null`, the exemption evaluates to false, and
 * the operator is refused at the chokepoint for EVERY action, including the one
 * that would lift the suspension. There is no in-band recovery from that.
 *
 * So the exemption asks a different question — "is this tenant the one holding
 * platform authority" — and answers it from identity alone. It grants nothing:
 * platform-scoped permissions still go through `resolvePlatformTenant` and its
 * active check, unchanged.
 *
 * Resolution order mirrors `resolvePlatformTenant` exactly, minus the status
 * filter, so the two can never name different tenants.
