 * ## Pure DATA, not an executable extractor
 *
 * This descriptor carries NO function reference — only reviewed, code-only
 * column/table NAMES and a declarative `publicationFilter`. `site_search`'s
 * generic engine builds a PARAMETERIZED extraction query from it: literal filter
 * VALUES are always bound parameters; only the IDENTIFIERS (table/column names)
 * are interpolated, and they are re-validated with a strict identifier pattern
 * immediately before interpolation — the exact discipline `data_lifecycle`'s
 * `generic` executionMode uses. There is no place for a tenant to inject SQL.

 * channel/topic live in `awcms_blog_terms` reached through
 * `awcms_blog_post_terms`, while institution lives in `awcms_blog_institutions`
 * reached through `awcms_blog_post_institutions`. A column name cannot say
 * "join". So the facets PRD FR-DSC-002 asks for were not merely unimplemented;

 * column on `awcms_blog_posts` (PRD §8.5 gives an article ONE region), and

 * builder would then have to honour.
 *
 * ## Every name here is interpolated into SQL
 *
 * Which is exactly why `assertSafeIdentifier`/`assertSafeTableName` exist and
 * why `site-search:sources:check` validates this shape in the same PR that
 * introduced it, rather than after. A descriptor is reviewed, code-only DATA —
 * never a function, never a fragment of SQL, never a value that reached the
 * process from a request. `valueEquals` VALUES are bound parameters; only
 * identifiers are interpolated.
 *
 * ## `value` and `label` are not the same field
 *
 * `value` is what a filter matches on and what a URL carries — a slug, a code,
 * something stable. `label` is what a reader sees. Collapsing them would either
 * put display text in a query string or slugs on screen, and renaming a channel
 * would silently break every saved filter.

   * ## Why this is not `redactedColumns`
   *
   * Until ADR-0108 there was one list, and the executor used it for both jobs.
   * That silently conflated two different questions, and the conflation had
   * teeth in both directions:
   *
   * - `awcms_profiles` names the person — `display_name`, `legal_name`. Those
   *   must be OVERWRITTEN and must still be EXPORTED (they are the subject's
   *   own data, and a subject-access request is largely about them). Under one
   *   list, declaring them would have withheld them from the export, so the
   *   descriptor declared nothing — and an "anonymised" profile kept the
   *   person's name. Three descriptors answered `anonymize` and wrote nothing
   *   at all.
   * - `awcms_identities.password_hash` must be overwritten AND never exported.
   *   That is the case one list happens to fit, which is why the defect was
   *   invisible: the tables where both answers coincide worked perfectly.
   *
   * So: `redactedColumns` answers "may the subject be handed this?" and this
   * field answers "must the erasure destroy this?". A column may be in both,
   * either, or neither.
   *
   * ## What the executor does with it
   *
   * Text-like columns get the shared `[erased]` sentinel; `jsonb`/`json` get an
   * empty object. A column that participates in any UNIQUE index gets a
   * per-row-unique sentinel instead — derived from `pg_index` at run time, not
   * declared here, because a declaration would be a second copy of the schema
   * that can rot. Without it, erasing a subject who holds TWO rows in such a
   * table (two invitations, two identifiers, two suppressed addresses) aborts
   * the whole erasure on a unique violation, mid-transaction, after the request
   * has already been claimed.
   *
   * `subject-data:registry:check` refuses an `anonymize` descriptor that names
   * no column here and has no `jsonb_array_contains` subject column, because
   * that combination is precisely "reports anonymisation, writes nothing"; and
   * it refuses a column name this table does not have.

/**
 * SemVer of this file's own exported type shape — independent of
 * `package.json` (release version) and OpenAPI/AsyncAPI `info.version`.
 * MAJOR: a field removed/renamed or an optional field becomes required.
 * MINOR: a new optional field added. PATCH: doc-only clarification.
 *
 * `1.1.0` — added the optional `ModuleDescriptor.reportingProjections`
 * field plus the `ProjectionDescriptor` family of exported types (MINOR:
 * purely additive), ported from awcms-mini Issue #753.
 *
 * `1.2.0` (Issue #178, epic #177 ERP-readiness) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.capabilities` field (`ModuleCapabilityContract`),
 * `ModuleCompatibilityContract.deploymentProfiles`, and the new
 * `ApplicationModuleRegistry`/`ModuleMigrationNamespace` composition types
 * (MINOR: purely additive, no existing field removed/retyped — every base
 * `module.ts` that only set the original fields stays valid unchanged).
 *
 * `1.3.0` (Issue #181, epic #177 Wave 2 authorization) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.sodRules` field plus the `SoDRuleDescriptor` family of
 * exported types (`SoDRuleScopeApplicability`/`SoDRuleSeverity`/
 * `SoDRuleExceptionPolicy`), ported from awcms-mini Issue #746 (MINOR: purely
 * additive — every base `module.ts` that omits `sodRules` stays valid).
 *
 * `2.0.0` (ADR-0034 §3 — derived application pathway removal) — REMOVED the
 * `ApplicationModuleRegistry` and `ModuleMigrationNamespace` composition types
 * (MAJOR: exported types removed). The derived-application seam
 * (`src/modules/application-registry.ts`, migration namespace 900-999,
 * `extension:check`) is deleted; the base is a template used directly. No
 * `ModuleDescriptor` field changed — every `module.ts` stays valid unchanged.
 *
 * `2.1.0` (ADR-0037, ported from awcms-micro Issue #745) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.dataLifecycle` field plus the `HighVolumeTableDescriptor`
 * family of exported types (`Lifecycle{TableScope,RetentionClass,ExecutionMode,
 * ArchivePortKind,ArchiveFormat,DeletionMode}`, `Lifecycle{Partition,Archive,
 * Deletion,LegalHold}Policy`, `LifecycleIndexRequirement`,
 * `LifecycleExistingAdopter`) — MINOR: purely additive, every base `module.ts`
 * that omits `dataLifecycle` stays valid unchanged.
 *
 * `2.2.0` (ADR-0040, ported from awcms-micro Issue #270) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.searchSources` field plus the `SearchSourceDescriptor` /
 * `SearchSourcePublicationFilter` exported types — MINOR: purely additive, every
 * base `module.ts` that omits `searchSources` stays valid unchanged.
 *
 * `2.3.0` (ADR-0041, ported from awcms-micro Issue #271) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.commentableResources` field plus the
 * `CommentableResourceDescriptor` / `CommentableResourcePublicationFilter` /
 * `CommentableResourceDefaultPolicy` exported types — MINOR: purely additive,
 * every base `module.ts` that omits `commentableResources` stays valid
 * unchanged.
 *
 * `2.4.0` (Issue #256, PR #267) — added `ModuleApiContract.routes`, making
 * route ownership DERIVABLE instead of inferred from a single `basePath`.
 * `tenant_admin` had declared `basePath: "/api/v1"` — a prefix of every route
 * in the application — so longest-prefix resolution handed it 36 routes it does
 * not own. MINOR: purely additive, `basePath` keeps its display/docs meaning.
 * This entry was MISSING from this changelog until 8 August 2026, which is how
 * `absorb-awcms-micro-roadmap.md` came to reserve `2.4.0` for a seam that had
 * not landed while the slot was already taken.
 *
 * `2.5.0` (ADR-0053) — added the optional `ModulePermissionDescriptor.scope`
 * field plus the `ModulePermissionScope` exported type — MINOR: purely
 * additive, and omitting it means `"tenant"`, which is exactly what every
 * existing descriptor already meant.
 *
 * `3.0.0` (ADR-0083 as amended 11 August 2026) — REMOVED the `"staging"` member
 * of the exported `ModuleDeploymentProfile` union. MAJOR by this file's own
 * rule and by the `2.0.0` precedent: the exported type shape SHRANK, so a
 * `module.ts` that was valid against `2.5.0` — any descriptor declaring
 * `compatibility.deploymentProfiles: ["staging", ...]` — stops compiling. No
 * base module declares `deploymentProfiles` at all, so the in-repo blast radius
 * is zero; the bump exists for the consumer that reads this number instead of
 * the diff. Deliberately NOT called a PATCH "documentation sync": narrowing a
 * published union is a capability withdrawal, and pretending otherwise would
 * let a downstream pin `^2` and get a type it cannot satisfy.
 *
 * `3.1.0` (ADR-0084, Gelombang 5 PR 5.1 of #423) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.requiresEntitlement` field. MINOR: purely additive, and
 * omitting it means "no commercial precondition", which is what every existing
 * descriptor already meant. No base module declares it, so the in-repo blast
 * radius is zero by construction — that is what "the wave lands inert" is.
 *
 * `3.2.0` (ADR-0094, Issue #542) — added the optional
 * `ModuleDescriptor.subjectData` field plus the `SubjectDataDescriptor` /
 * `SubjectDataErasure` exported types. MINOR: purely additive, and omitting it
 * means the table has not answered the subject question yet — which
 * `subject-data:coverage:check` allows only for tables that predate the rule,
 * on a ledger that may only shrink.
 *
 * `4.0.0` (ADR-0094 wave 2, Issue #557) — two changes to the `subjectData`
 * family, both MAJOR by this file's own rule:
 *
 * - `SubjectDataErasure` gained the member `"severed_with_subject_row"`. A
 *   widened union is MAJOR here because the consumers that matter are
 *   exhaustive `switch`es over it, and the whole point of adding it is that
 *   they must each decide what it means rather than fall through a `default`.
 * - `SubjectDataDescriptor.tenantColumn` was retyped `string | null`, so an
 *   explicit `null` states "this table is global" instead of the previous
 *   encoding where absence meant both "use `tenant_id`" and "global at once" —
 *   a contradiction the planner resolved by silently binding `tenant_id`.
 *
 * No `ModuleDescriptor` field was removed and every wave-1 descriptor stays
 * valid unchanged.
 *
 * `4.1.0` (ADR-0108) — added the optional
 * `SubjectDataDescriptor.anonymizedColumns` and NARROWED the documented meaning
 * of `redactedColumns` to export exclusion alone. MINOR: the field is additive
 * and no existing descriptor becomes invalid. It is a behaviour change for the
 * ERASURE, though — the executor now writes what `anonymizedColumns` names
 * rather than what `redactedColumns` named, so every `anonymize` descriptor was
 * updated in the same change, and `subject-data:registry:check` refuses an
 * `anonymize` that names nothing so the omission cannot be silent.
 *
 * `4.2.0` (Issue #117, contract #106 / ADR-0017 D7) — added the optional
 * `ProjectionCursorStream.dimensional` (`ProjectionDimensionalSink`) and
 * `ProjectionDescriptor.dimensional` (`ProjectionDimensionalContract`,
 * `ProjectionDimensionalTotals`) fields, so a module can contribute a
 * projection whose read model is per-day/per-product/per-category figures in
 * its OWN table(s) rather than the engine's scalar counters. MINOR: purely
 * additive — every existing descriptor omits both and behaves exactly as
 * before; `reporting:projections:registry:check` enforces that the two new
 * fields are declared together or not at all.
