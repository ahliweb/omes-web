/**
 * Shared worker runner (Issue #697, epic #679, platform-hardening).
 *
 * Every `scripts/*.ts` cron/systemd worker (`bun run logs:audit:purge`,
 * `bun run domain-events:dispatch`, ...) re-implements the same handful of concerns
 * slightly differently: iterate tenants, generate a correlation/run id,
 * decide the process exit code, print a completion summary, and log
 * failures safely. `runJob` is the single place that logic now lives —
 * migrating a script to it is OPTIONAL and incremental (see
 * `docs/awcms/deployment-profiles.md` §Shared worker runner); scripts
 * that have not migrated yet remain fully valid.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do: it is not a job *queue* — it
 * has no persistence, no scheduling, no cross-process work distribution,
 * and no automatic retry-with-backoff loop. Scheduling stays exactly what
 * it already is (an external cron/systemd timer/container scheduler
 * invoking `bun run <script>`); this only makes a single invocation of a
 * single script safer and more observable. Introducing an orchestration
 * platform (BullMQ, Temporal, ...) is explicitly out of scope (issue text:
 * "tanpa memperkenalkan orchestration platform terpisah").
 *
 * Composition, not a god-object: `runJob` composes three independent
 * modules a caller can also use directly —
 * `./advisory-lock.ts` (duplicate-run prevention),
 * `./batching.ts` (bounded tenant/item iteration), and
 * `./retry-classification.ts` (safe-to-retry-next-tick classification) —
 * plus `../logging/error-sanitizer.ts` (Issue #687) for redaction. No new
 * redaction/log-masking mechanism is added here.

/**
 * Runs `definition.handler` under a per-job-name advisory lock, a timeout,

 * redacted telemetry (`JobResult`) rather than throwing — `runJob` itself
 * never rejects (a thrown handler error becomes `status: "failed"` with a
 * sanitized `error`), so callers always get a result to log/exit on.
 *
 * Lock release, precisely:
 * - **Success or a thrown handler error** — the handler has, by definition,
 *   already fully stopped running by the time `runJob` observes either
 *   outcome, so the lock is released SYNCHRONOUSLY in the same `finally`
 *   block that returns the result. No gap here at all.
 * - **Timeout or termination signal** — `runJob` returns its
 *   `"timeout"`/`"terminated"` result PROMPTLY (never blocks the caller/cron
 *   tick waiting for the handler), but the lock is deliberately NOT released
 *   in that same moment. PR #713's security review found the earlier
 *   version released the lock immediately here, while `handler` (e.g. a
 *   multi-tenant loop inside `iterateTenantsInBatches`) was often still
 *   actively running in the background on its own connections — letting a
 *   second scheduled tick acquire the now-"free" lock and start a genuinely
 *   overlapping second execution of the SAME job, exactly the failure mode
 *   mutual exclusion exists to prevent. Instead, a detached background
 *   continuation (`scheduleBackgroundLockRelease`, decoupled from this
 *   function's own return) keeps the lock held until EITHER `handler`
 *   actually settles OR `lockReleaseGraceMs` (default
 *   `DEFAULT_LOCK_RELEASE_GRACE_MS`, 30s) elapses, whichever comes first,
 *   then releases it. A handler built on `iterateTenantsInBatches`/
 *   `runBoundedBatches` (which check `ctx.signal` between passes/tenants,
 *   see `batching.ts`) typically stops within about one in-flight
 *   statement's duration of the abort firing — well inside the default
 *   grace window in practice. A handler that never checks the signal at
 *   all is still bounded: the lock is held for at most `lockReleaseGraceMs`
 *   longer than before, not indefinitely (preserving "never block a cron
 *   tick forever" — the CALLER was never blocked either way; only the
 *   lock's OWN release is delayed, in a fire-and-forget task this function
 *   does not await).
 *
 * Cancellation model: `timeoutMs` and the termination signals both call the
 * same `AbortController.abort()` — this only *signals* the handler via
 * `ctx.signal`; it cannot forcibly interrupt a handler that never checks
 * the signal or awaits anything (standard `AbortSignal` cooperative-
 * cancellation limits, not something this runner can work around without a
 * separate OS process per job, which would turn this into the orchestration
 * platform the issue explicitly says not to build). What IS guaranteed
 * regardless of handler cooperation is: (a) `runJob` returns promptly with
 * `status: "timeout"`/`"terminated"` instead of hanging forever, and (b) a
 * SECOND `runJob`/`acquireAdvisoryLock` call for the SAME job name is
 * rejected/skipped for as long as the first handler is genuinely still
 * running (bounded by `lockReleaseGraceMs`), not just until `runJob`'s own
 * promise resolves — see `tests/integration/job-runner.integration.test.ts`
 * for the exact regression scenario this closes.
