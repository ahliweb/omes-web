/**
 * Issue #151 — rebuild vs. incremental mutual exclusion, against a REAL
 * PostgreSQL.
 *
 * Why a real database and not a `Bun.SQL` double: the bug being pinned is a
 * TOCTOU between two transactions, and the fix is a `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
 * (`src/modules/reporting/application/projection-lock.ts`). Both the bug
 * and the fix are properties of Postgres' own concurrency behavior —
 * transaction boundaries, READ COMMITTED per-statement snapshots, lock
 * waits. A mock has none of those, so a mock-based test could only assert
 * "the code calls the function we told it to call", which would pass
 * against an implementation that still double-counts.
 *
 * Gated on `DATABASE_URL`, the same convention this repo's CI already uses:
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `quality` job has no Postgres service and no
 * `DATABASE_URL`, so these skip cleanly there; they actually execute in
 * `ci.yml`'s `integration-tests` job and `release.yml`'s `validate` job, each
 * in a dedicated `bun test <legacy files>` step run separately from the
 * harness-based `tests/integration/` suite (see `tests/integration/
 * harness.ts` — the two collide if run together in one `bun test` process).
 *
 * DETERMINISM (no sleep-and-hope on the ASSERTED behavior): every test
 * below forces the interleaving with a real lock held by a dedicated
 * connection the test itself controls, rather than racing two workers and
 * hoping the window is hit. The `sleep`s only ever give the OLD (buggy)
 * code time to finish doing the wrong thing — making the failure it
 * produces reliable, never masking one.
