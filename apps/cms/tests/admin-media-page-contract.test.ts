/**
 * `/admin/media` gates against the endpoints it drives, and is explicit about
 * the permissions it deliberately does NOT drive.
 *
 * Sixth of the admin page contracts, and the one that closes ADR-0021's first
 * criterion: after this, no module in this base is without a screen.
 *
 * What is specific here is that this page could not have existed before its
 * three ADR-0056 steps landed. So the assertions run in both directions: the
 * page drives exactly the permissions that are now enforced, and the ones it
 * skips are skipped for a stated reason rather than missed.
 *
 * Issue #595 moved `media.create` from the second set to the first — see the
 * note on `DELIBERATE_ABSENCES` for why that is a reversal with a reason and
 * not an erosion of the contract.
 *
 * Three traps specific to this module:
 *
 * - **`media.attach`/`media.detach` are REVOKED** (`sql/087`). A control gated
 *   on either would deny every caller including the owner, because no migration
 *   seeds them any more — the latent-authz shape, arrived at from the other
 *   direction than usual.
 * - **`enforcement.enable` is one-way and tenant-wide.** It is not an object
 *   action, and a button for it beside a row of thumbnails would misrepresent
 *   what it does. There is deliberately no `enforcement.disable` anywhere.
 * - **No `<img>` preview.** A registry row can be `pending_upload` or `failed`
 *   — the bytes may be absent, unverified, or the very thing the operator came
 *   to remove. Rendering them shows a policy-violating image one more time, to
 *   the person removing it.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
