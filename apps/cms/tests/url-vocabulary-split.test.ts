/**
 * ADR-0071 §4 must agree with the filesystem it schedules work against.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists at all
 *
 * ADR-0071 splits the family's public URL vocabulary — `/blog/**` here,
 * `/news/**` in `awcms-astro` — and the rule took effect the day it landed
 * while the code did not: the four routes ADR-0059 built were still served, and
 * `publicRouteMode` still defaulted to `domain_default`. §4 stated that window
 * openly, and this gate held the ADR to it until the removal shipped. The
 * window is now CLOSED (§4 reads `SUDAH DILAKSANAKAN`, `src/pages/news` is
 * gone), which is exactly when the gate's second job begins — see rule (e).
 *
 * A stated window is a promise, and this repo's whole convention is that a
 * promise without a checker is a promise that gets forgotten. The natural
 * mechanism — `Accepted (not yet implemented)` and
 * `tests/adr-implementation-status.test.ts` — CANNOT be used here, and the
 * reason is worth writing down because it will come up again: that gate binds
 * the qualifier to the PRESENCE of promised artifacts (absent → qualified,
 * present → plain). ADR-0071 promises a REMOVAL, so the direction is inverted,
 * and rule (d) of that gate forbids the qualifier off-map. Hence this gate:
 * same two-way discipline, opposite shape of promise.
 *
 * ## What it enforces
 *
 * - (a) routes present → §4 MUST read `BELUM DILAKSANAKAN`;
 * - (b) routes absent  → §4 MUST read `SUDAH DILAKSANAKAN` — removing them
 *   forces the flip in the same PR;
 * - (c) exactly one marker — an ADR carrying both says nothing;
 * - (d) the ADR file itself must exist, so the gate cannot pass by vacuity;
 * - (e) routes absent → no CURRENT-STATE document may still claim they exist.
 *
 * Rule (e) is the half this gate was missing, and the omission had already
 * cost: after the removal landed, `AGENTS.md` — the first file every agent
 * reads — still carried a blockquote SCHEDULING the deletion as outstanding
 * work, naming this very test as its enforcer. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` said the
 * routes "SUDAH ada"; `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` listed the family under "sudah
 * selesai (jangan dibangun ulang)"; the `awcms-blog-content` skill frontmatter
 * advertised "DUA keluarga rute publik". Every one of those passed rules (a)-(d)
 * because those rules only ever read the ADR and the filesystem.
 *
 * That direction of rot is the dangerous one. "This does not exist yet" ages
 * into a confident lie that sends the next reader to build what is already
 * built; here the mirror image sent them to find what was already deleted, or
 * to rebuild a route family the ADR three paragraphs above forbids.
 *
 * The decision logic is a pure function over an injected snapshot and is
 * mutation-proven below: each direction has a test feeding it the defect it
 * must catch. No database, no network.
