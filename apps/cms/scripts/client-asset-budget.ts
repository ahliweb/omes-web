/**
 * client-asset-budget.ts — `bun run build:asset-budget:check`.
 *
 * Closes gap C6 of `docs/awcms/standar-performa-dan-keamanan.md` §9: the repo
 * had no budget on what the browser must download. Runs AFTER `astro build`
 * (the `build` target chains it) and fails when `dist/client` outgrows the
 * budgets below. Pure filesystem arithmetic — no database, no network.
 *
 * ## Why gate this today
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-05, `dist/client` is 139,048 bytes across 45 files —
 * 35 JS files (77,449 B) and 10 CSS files (61,599 B); the largest single file
 * is `css/public-content.css` at 16,800 B. That is the cheapest moment a
 * budget will ever have: every later moment starts from a bigger baseline and
 * a budget written then would ratify whatever had already accreted. Client
 * weight grows one island at a time and no test notices; the symptom arrives
 * as "the public pages feel slow" long after the import that caused it.
 *
 * ## The budgets, derived from that measurement
 *
 * The original single ceiling (`TOTAL_BUDGET_BYTES` = 180,000 — baseline
 * 139,048 B + ~29% headroom) was split by ADR-0101 into one budget per
 * audience, `READER_BUDGET_BYTES` and `APP_BUDGET_BYTES`; see the section on
 * the split below for the measurement that forced it. Both still catch slow
 * accretion, now without one surface's growth hiding inside the other's.
 *
 * - `PER_FILE_BUDGET_BYTES` = 21,000 — largest file 16,800 B + 25%. Catches
 *   the other failure mode: one island importing a charting/date/editor
 *   dependency and shipping it as a single 200 KB chunk, which a generous
 *   total budget alone would absorb for a while and then blame on the NEXT
 *   change.
 *
 * Raising a budget is allowed — deliberately. The constant lives here so the
 * raise is a reviewed diff, and the reviewer's question is written down: what
 * feature bought this weight, and was it re-measured (`du -sb dist/client`)
 * rather than bumped until green?
 *
 * ## The first time that question was asked, the answer was no (Issue #552)
 *
 * On 2026-08-13 five admin screens landed in one day and the total reached
 * 176,670 B — 3,330 B of headroom, about two more screens. The budget had done
 * exactly what it exists to do, and the tempting fix was to raise it.
 *
 * It was not raised. The measurement said why: per-page script chunks were
 * 98,379 B across 43 files sharing 1,039 B between them, because every screen
 * hand-wrote the same lock/send/reload/report lifecycle. Moving that lifecycle
 * into `src/lib/ui/admin-form-client.ts` and converting all 36 screens took the
 * total to 153,970 B — 26,030 B of headroom, from a change that shipped no
 * less behaviour. A raise would have bought the same headroom by deleting the
 * question.
 *
 * That is the precedent this constant is meant to force, and it is recorded
 * here rather than in a commit message because the next person to hit the
 * ceiling reads this file, not the log.
 *
 * ## Why nothing is excluded
 *
 * Content images never pass through the build — they live in R2 via
 * `media_library`. A pre-emptive exclusion class (e.g. "images don't count")
 * would be a blind spot with no current benefit: if image files ever appear in
 * `dist/client`, that is exactly the growth this gate exists to surface, and
 * the right response is a deliberate exclusion recorded here, not a silent one.
 *
 * **This section used to end "and no fonts are shipped". ADR-0120 shipped
 * five.** It is recorded here rather than quietly amended because that sentence
 * is the kind of claim this file elsewhere calls "an assertion nothing
 * re-checks". Fonts were NOT given the silent exclusion the paragraph warns
 * against: they are a third audience with their own ceiling
 * (`FONT_BUDGET_BYTES`), for reasons set out there. Nothing is excluded from
 * measurement; one thing is measured against its own number.
 *
 * ## Why a missing or empty `dist/client` FAILS
 *
 * A gate that passes when its input is absent is the "green while wrong"
 * failure mode this repo has recorded more than once. No `dist/client` means
 * the build has not run — the fix is `bun run build`, and the message says so.
 * An EMPTY `dist/client` fails for the same reason: the build always emits
 * CSS for the admin screens, so zero files means this script is measuring the
 * wrong directory or the build broke, never that the client got lighter.

/**
 * What the APP surface downloads (admin, auth, landing, theming preview):
 * 165,274 B measured 2026-08-20, budget 172,000 (~4%).
 *
 * This inherits the accretion history below — it is the old total minus the
 * reader assets, and it keeps the old total's job of catching slow growth one
 * admin screen at a time.
 *
 * Its immediate predecessor was `TOTAL_BUDGET_BYTES` = 192,000, **raised on 19
 * August 2026 for the Portable Text block editor (ADR-0100, Issue #589), and
 * the measurement was the argument.**
 *
 * Measured on clean builds. That used to be a manual `rm -rf dist &&` that this
 * docblock told the reader not to skip — and the instruction was ignored twice,
 * once here (a 2,493 B admin screen first reported as 82 B) and again on 22
 * August 2026, when a phantom 425 B "saving" sent a whole PR down the wrong
 * road. A gate that documents its own hazard is a gate that will mislead
 * somebody a third time, so `bun run build` now runs `build:clean` first and
 * the number cannot come from a tree the current build did not produce:
 *
 * ```
 * main                                     181,418 B
 * + the block editor                       186,689 B   (delta 5,271 B)
 * ```
 *
 * **5,271 B for a rich-text editor** — 3,942 B of client script and 1,329 B of
 * CSS. That number is the whole decision record for Issue #589. The alternative
 * on the table was TipTap + ProseMirror, roughly 150-250 kB across ~20
 * transitive packages, which would have broken the 27,000 B per-file cap about
 * tenfold and roughly doubled this total, in a repo that ships exactly TWO
 * runtime dependencies.
 *
 * It is that small because the vocabulary is CLOSED (ADR-0100): three
 * decorators, one annotation, eight block styles, two list kinds. A general
 * editing framework is large because it must handle a vocabulary nobody has
 * enumerated; this one does not, so it does not need one.
 *
 * ## History worth keeping, because two earlier numbers here were wrong
 *
 * 180,000 -> briefly 190,000 -> back to 180,000 -> 184,000 -> 192,000.
 *
 * The 190,000 raise rested on `main` measuring 181,336 B against a 180,000 B
 * ceiling — true when measured, and then astro 7.2.0 -> 7.2.3 shed 2,411 B of
 * its own output and put `main` back under. It was reverted rather than kept: a
 * budget raised past a breach that has since healed has stopped measuring
 * anything. 184,000 followed a real 2,493 B admin screen (first reported as
 * 82 B, measured against a stale `dist`).
 *
 * ## A hypothesis worth not re-testing (Issue #590)
 *
 * The hypothesis that `_astro/error-log.*.css` (24,909 B, the largest file) is
 * bloated by duplicating `admin-screens.css` is **DISPROVED**. That chunk is
 * `src/styles/admin.css` (37,596 B of source), the AdminLayout stylesheet; it
 * carries `.admin-shell`/`.skip-link` while `_astro/admin-screens.*.css`
 * separately carries `.page-header`/`.admin-section-title`. They share nothing.
 * It is merely NAMED after `error-log` because Vite names a shared CSS chunk
 * after one of its JS importers.
 *
 * ## The split this file now enforces (Issue #590, ADR-0101)
 *
 * A single conflated ceiling was measuring the wrong thing. Attribution from
 * Astro's own SSR route manifest (`dist/server/entry.mjs`, not from file
 * names) on 2026-08-20:
 *
 * ```
 * reader  (public content pages)   21,415 B   css/public-content.css + js/news-share.js
 * app     (admin, auth, landing)  165,274 B   every _astro/* chunk + push-sw.js
 * ```
 *
 * **The decisive fact: a public content page loads ZERO `_astro` assets.**
 * Those pages are not Astro components — `src/pages/blog/`, `[...path].ts`,
 * the feeds and the sitemaps are `.ts` routes that emit their own shell via
 * `public-page-rendering.ts`, linking two absolute paths out of `public/`. The
 * only non-admin routes carrying `styles` in the manifest are `/`, the five
 * auth pages, and `/theming/preview/[token]`.
 *
 * So reader weight was 11% of a number dominated by admin, which made it
 * effectively unmeasured: a 5,000 B reader-facing regression is a **23%**
 * increase in what a reader downloads — exactly the premise this budget was
 * built on — and it passed silently under a 192,000 B ceiling.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this comment said "roughly 40% of the total is
 * admin-only". That was wrong in the other direction: admin-reachable is ~73%
 * once page scripts are counted. Both numbers were guesses at a split nobody
 * had measured; the two budgets below are measured.
 */
/**
 * **Raised to 178,000 on 20 August 2026 for the Issue #595 authoring surface,
 * and the gate's own question was answered first.**
 *
 * The failure message asks whether the growth is per-screen duplication, the
 * way Issue #552's was — 43 screens hand-copying one lifecycle, which a shared
 * module recovered 22,700 B from. It is not. Three features bought it, each
 * shipping behaviour that did not exist:
 *
 * ```
 * after ADR-0101                     165,274 B
 * + media upload UI      (#610)      169,128 B   (+3,854)
 * + article SEO fields   (#611)      169,417 B   (+  289)
 * + featured-image picker(#612)      173,050 B   (+3,633)
 * ```
 *
 * The picker is a shared module (`lib/ui/media-picker-client.ts`) imported by
 * one screen today and by ad inventory (#594) next, so its bytes are paid once
 * rather than per screen — the shape #552 established, applied before the
 * second consumer exists rather than after.
 *
 * 178,000 is measured + ~2.9%. Deliberately not the ~4% the previous value
 * carried: the reader budget is where the tight constraint belongs, but the
 * admin surface has now grown three times in one working day, and a wider
 * margin here would buy silence rather than room.
 */
/**
 * **Raised to 185,000 on 21 August 2026 for `/admin/site-profile` (Issue #596,
 * ADR-0102), and the gate's question was answered with a change rather than an
 * argument.**
 *
 * It fired at 181,626 B and asked whether the growth was per-screen
 * duplication. **Part of it was.** `/admin/site-profile` is the second screen
 * to need the media picker, and its wiring had been hand-copied from
 * `/admin/blog` — the exact Issue #552 shape, caught this time BEFORE it
 * landed rather than 43 screens later. Extracting `wireMediaPickers` into
 * `lib/ui/media-picker-client.ts` gave back 1,444 B:
 *
 * ```
 * with the copy                      181,626 B
 * after extracting wireMediaPickers  180,182 B   (-1,444)
 * ```
 *
 * What remains is a genuinely new screen — a form with nine fields, a
 * repeating social-links builder, and two media choosers — shipping behaviour
 * that did not exist. 185,000 is measured + ~2.7%.
 *
 * **Raised to 186,000 on 21 August 2026 for the usage-rights editor on
 * `/admin/media` (Issue #615), after asking the gate's question and getting a
 * different answer this time.**
 *
 * It fired at 185,095 B — 95 over. The growth is 649 B, all of it in
 * `media.astro`'s own island:
 *
 * ```
 * media.astro island, before   5,360 B
 * media.astro island, after    6,009 B   (+649)
 * ```
 *
 * Checked for the Issue #552 shape and it is not there: the editor reuses
 * `messageBox`, `mutateAndReload`, `sendJson` and `inputValue` from
 * `lib/ui/admin-form-client.ts`, and its own code is one submit handler. The
 * form itself is SERVER-rendered from `?rights=<id>` precisely so the page
 * ships no client code for populating fields from row data — the cheaper of the
 * two designs was already taken.
 *
 * So this is a genuine addition: a newsroom could not record who took a
 * photograph at all, and now can. 186,000 is measured + ~0.5%, deliberately
 * tight — a wider margin here would buy silence rather than room, which is the
 * reason the previous raise gave for staying close to the measurement.
 *
 * **Raised to 192,000 on 21 August 2026 for the editor preview's in-place
 * editing overlay (Issue #592), and the gate's question has an unusually direct
 * answer this time.**
 *
 * Measured on clean builds (`rm -rf dist && bun run build`):
 *
 * ```
 * main                                     185,690 B
 * + js/blog-preview-overlay.js             191,299 B   (delta 5,609 B)
 * ```
 *
 * The delta is the new file EXACTLY — no `_astro` chunk moved by a byte, which
 * is the check that the overlay did not quietly pull anything into the admin
 * screens' bundles.
 *
 * The failure message asks whether the growth is per-screen duplication, the
 * Issue #552 shape. It is the opposite: this bundle exists BECAUSE the
 * alternative was duplication. `preview.ts` is an `APIRoute`, Astro bundles
 * `<script>` only for `.astro` components, and hand-writing the overlay into
 * `public/js/` the way `news-share.js` is written would have meant a second,
 * untyped copy of the block <-> Portable Text conversion
 * `lib/ui/portable-text-editor.ts` owns. `bun run build:preview-overlay` buys
 * one definition, typechecked, for 5,609 B.
 *
 * For scale, the whole Portable Text block editor cost 5,271 B (see the ADR-0100
 * entry above), and tree-shaking is doing its job here: `admin-form-client.ts`
 * contributes `sendJson` and nothing else, and neither renderer is in the file —
 * after a save the page RELOADS, so the server stays the only renderer.
 *
 * 192,000 is measured + ~0.4%, the same deliberately tight margin the last two
 * raises argued for.
 *
 * ## 193,500 (2026-08-25) — `/admin/access-policies`
 *
 * The DSL policy screen's own handler: parse role codes, POST the simulation,
 * render the decision. **767 B**, which was very nearly the whole 724 B
 * overage on its own.
 *
 * The failure message asks whether the growth is per-screen duplication, and
 * the answer was checked rather than assumed. The built chunk opens
 * `import{c as e,d as t,…}from"./admin-form-client.dRVcYtE0.js"` — it REFERENCES
 * the shared 2,321 B helper chunk instead of inlining a copy, which is what the
 * 767 B figure is evidence of: an inlined lifecycle would have made this chunk
 * several kB, the Issue #552 shape. For scale it is the smallest admin script
 * in the build (`approvals` is 2,926 B, `business-scope` 3,563 B, `blog`
 * 12,686 B).
 *
 * So this is a new screen paying its own way, not accretion. 193,500 is
 * measured + ~0.4%, holding the same tight margin rather than buying room for
 * the next one.
 */
/**
 * **Raised to 218,000 on 2 September 2026 for the admin redesign (ADR-0120),
 * and the gate's question was answered with a measurement rather than a
 * shrug.**
 *
 * The failure message asks whether the growth is per-screen duplication — the
 * Issue #552 shape. It is measurably the opposite. Both builds clean, both on
 * this machine, `dist/client/_astro` split by kind:
 *
 * ```
 *                    JS          CSS         app total
 * main            119,403      61,283         192,724
 * redesign        120,772      80,749         213,559
 * delta            +1,369     +19,466         +20,835
 * ```
 *
 * **JS moved 1,369 B, and that is the entire command palette** — a `<dialog>`,
 * a filter over links already in the page, and the Cmd/Ctrl+K handler. It is
 * that small because the palette does not fetch: `AdminLayout` renders the nav
 * entries the caller may already see, and the script only shows and hides them
 * (see `src/lib/ui/admin-command-palette.ts` for why that also settles the
 * permission question structurally).
 *
 * The 19,466 B of CSS is the design system, and every byte of it is in the two
 * stylesheets EVERY admin screen already loads:
 *
 * ```
 * _astro/AdminLayout.css   24,909 -> 39,990   (+15,081)  admin.css
 * _astro/admin-screens.css  9,111 ->  9,889   (+  778)
 * _astro/motion.css         6,570 ->  8,952   (+2,382)   chunk rebalancing
 * auth.css -> AuthBrandPanel 5,633 ->  6,872  (+1,239)   split login panel
 * ```
 *
 * Per-screen weight went DOWN, not up: 45 screens each stopped rendering their
 * own `<header class="page-header">` with an `<h1>` and a description, because
 * the shell renders that band now.
 *
 * ## The next lever, recorded so it is not rediscovered
 *
 * The admin has SIX card-ish classes — `.admin-card`, `.admin-panel`,
 * `.admin-frame`, `.dashboard-card`, `.stat-card`, `.kpi` — and at least three
 * of them are the same object under different names (`.admin-card` and
 * `.admin-panel` are both "a padded surface with a border and a shadow").
 * Consolidating them is worth low thousands of bytes and, more importantly, one
 * fewer decision per screen. It was NOT done here because it touches all 48
 * screens' markup and this change already touches 45; doing both at once would
 * make the diff unreviewable.
 *
 * 218,000 is measured + ~2.1%, holding the tight margin the raises above
 * established — a wider one would buy silence rather than room.
 *
 * ## Raised to 219,000 for the commerce product/category CRUD screens
 * (Issue #23, 16 September 2026)
 *
 * `/admin/commerce` went from a read-only list to a full product CRUD screen
 * (filters, create form, per-row edit, an images picker, a variants editor,
 * status transition, soft delete, restore), and `/admin/commerce-categories`
 * is an entirely new screen. Measured on a clean build:
 *
 * ```
 * commerce.astro_...lang.js              3,568 B
 * commerce-categories.astro_...lang.js   1,406 B
 * total new client script                4,974 B
 * ```
 *
 * No new CSS: both screens reuse the existing `.admin-create-form`/
 * `.data-table`/`.row-actions`/`.admin-section` classes every other CRUD
 * screen already loads — the whole increase is client script for
 * genuinely new interactions (per-row edit forms, an image/variant add
 * flow), not duplication of something already on the page. 218,986 B
 * measured; 219,000 keeps the same tight-margin convention as every raise
 * above rather than buying slack for the next screen to spend unnoticed.
 */
/**
 * 227,391 B measured after Issue #26 (awcms-one epic #21) — six new admin
 * screens for the marketing surface, one per resource family, each with its
 * own small client script for the same create/edit/delete interactions the
 * #23 screens established:
 *
 * ```
 * commerce-flash-sales.astro_...lang.js   1,934 B
 * commerce-testimonials.astro_...lang.js  1,473 B
 * commerce-popup.astro_...lang.js         1,306 B

 * commerce-vouchers.astro_...lang.js      1,270 B
 * commerce-settings.astro_...lang.js      1,136 B
 * total new client script                 8,405 B
 * ```
 *
 * Again no new CSS — every screen reuses the existing admin classes. The
 * per-screen scripts are ~1.2–1.9 kB each because each one is the same
 * pattern (a `sendJson` helper + one submit handler per form) specialised
 * to its endpoint; Issue #552's consolidation lesson applies the moment
 * a SEVENTH commerce screen arrives, and the honest next step then is one
 * shared `admin-commerce-crud.ts` module rather than a ninth copy — not
 * another raise. 228,000 keeps the tight-margin convention.
 *
 * 229,054 B measured after Issue #29 (awcms-one epic #21) — three more admin
 * screens for the transactional surface (orders, customers, reviews), same
 * pattern as #26's raise above:
 *
 * ```
 * commerce-reviews.astro_...lang.js    748 B
 * commerce-customers.astro_...lang.js  474 B
 * commerce-orders.astro_...lang.js     441 B
 * total new client script             1,663 B
 * ```
 *
 * Again no new CSS — all three reuse the existing `data-table`/`row-actions`/
 * `module-toggle` classes `commerce-vouchers.astro` already established, and
 * `commerce-reviews.astro`'s own script is the largest of the three (three
 * actions — publish/reject/delete — where the others have one). 230,000
 * keeps a small margin above the measured total rather than the tightest
 * possible number, since a seventh call site here is still one honest
 * `sendJson` handler per screen, not yet the duplication Issue #552's
 * consolidation lesson warns about.
 *
 * 230,682 B measured after Issue #92 (awcms-one epic #32, C4) — one more
 * admin screen, `commerce-affiliates.astro` (two tables: affiliates with
 * suspend/activate/edit-rate, commissions with approve/pay/void), client
 * script `commerce-affiliates.astro_..._lang.js` 1,563 B. This IS past the
 * "seventh call site" mark the #29 comment above already flagged as the
 * point a shared `admin-commerce-crud.ts` module becomes the honest next
 * step rather than another raise — noted here rather than silently ignored,
 * but out of scope for #92 to build; the script itself already factors its
 * own three-way PATCH/POST duplication into two small local helpers rather
 * than one `sendJson` call per button, the same consolidation instinct at
 * screen scale. 231,000 keeps a small margin above the measured total.
 *
 * **Raised to 231,500 B after Issue #107** (awcms-one epic #33, C1) — the
 * courier-settings section added to `commerce-settings.astro` (an enabled
 * toggle, a debounced origin-destination search against `GET .../commerce/
 * shipping/destinations` rendered through a native `<datalist>` rather than
 * custom list markup, and a couriers multi-select), measured at 1,748 B for
 * the whole screen's script chunk. The new logic itself is ~620 B: it
 * reuses this same screen's own `el`/`val`/`orNull` one-line helpers rather
 * than adding a second copy, asserts elements that render under the exact
 * same permission gate as every other field on the form instead of
 * re-guarding them, and resolves the picked destination through the search
 * box's OWN value (the browser fills it in on pick) rather than a second
 * mirrored field to keep in sync — the Issue #552 "one shared lifecycle,
 * not one per screen" lesson, applied to a genuinely new control this repo
 * had none of yet, not per-screen duplication of one that already existed.
 *
 * 231,405 B measured after Issue #111 (contract #106 D8) — one more admin
 * screen, `commerce-inbox.astro` (conversation list with status/unread
 * filters, a thread view, a reply form, close/reopen). Its own client
 * script is 624 B, built on `onSubmit`/`onAction`/`mutateAndReload` (the
 * exact consolidation Issue #552 introduced) rather than a hand-rolled
 * lock/send/reload lifecycle — no per-screen duplication to fix here, only
 * the unavoidable cost of a genuinely new screen plus its own i18n
 * catalogue entries. Measured on its own branch point at 231,405 B; measured
 * again after merging #107's courier-settings section above, the combined
 * total is 231,919 B — the two additions are independent (a new screen and a
 * new control on an existing screen), so their costs simply add. 232,000
 * keeps the same small margin above the measured total this constant's own
 * history already establishes.
 *
 * **Raised to 234,200 B after Issue #114** (contract #106 ADR-0017 D9) —
 * one more admin screen, `commerce-campaigns.astro` (a campaign list, a
 * create-draft form with channel/subject/message fields and customer-level
 * checkboxes, and a detail/editor panel with an audience-preview button and
 * send/cancel actions). Measured at 233,778 B total (up from 231,919 B —
 * this screen's own cost, no other surface changed), so this constant keeps
 * the same small margin above the measured total this constant's own
 * history already establishes.
 *
 * **Raised to 234,800 B after merging Issue #110 on top of #111 and #114** (awcms-one
 * epic #33, C3) — the payment-gateway section added to the same
 * `commerce-settings.astro` screen: a `payment.gateway.enabled` toggle
 * (reusing the exact courier toggle's re-attach shape above) plus a
 * webhook-endpoint create/revoke panel built entirely from the shared
 * `onSubmit`/`onAction`/`mutateAndReload`/`sendJson`/`sendJsonForData`/
 * `field`/`messageBox` helpers `machine-credentials.astro` already
 * established — no new lifecycle code, no hand-rolled DOM row
 * construction. Measured at 231,939 B on its own branch point (231,500 +
 * ~440 B for this genuinely new control); measured again after merging
 * #111's inbox screen the total was 232,662 B; measured once more after
 * merging #114's campaigns screen above, the combined total is 234,521 B —
 * independent additions whose costs add, plus each screen's own i18n
 * catalogue entries sharing one compiled catalogue. 234,800 keeps the
 * same small margin above the measured total this constant's history uses.
 *
 * **Raised to 235,000 B after Issue #117** (contract #106 ADR-0017 D7) —
 * one more admin screen, `commerce-reports.astro` (a GET date-range form,
 * three SSR tables, and a per-projection "Export CSV" button whose only
 * client code is one `onAction` + `mutateAndReload` + `sendJson` call from
 * the shared `admin-form-client.ts` — no new lifecycle code). Its own
 * script bundles to a few hundred bytes; the rest of the growth is the
 * screen's 45 i18n catalogue entries in the shared compiled catalogue.
 * Measured at 234,889 B total (up from 234,521 B, +368 B — this screen's
 * own cost, no other surface changed), so this constant keeps the same
 * small margin above the measured total this constant's history uses.

// handler: a debounced product search over the owner products endpoint, an
// in-memory cart with editable quantities and a `bigint`-cents subtotal
// preview, a cash/QRIS tendered-amount + live-change control, a receipt
// rendered from the server's 201 body, and the submit itself — the one
// place `awcms-ui-screen` §5 names ("interactivity only inside islands
// (POS, forms, chat)"). Measured on the merged tree: 246,276 B (up from
// 237,558 B, +8,718 B — exactly this screen's own two assets: its bundled
// script 5,854 B and its scoped stylesheet 2,864 B, of which ~800 B is the
// `@media print` receipt block; no other surface changed, and the 35 new
// i18n catalogue entries are SSR-only). The script reuses
// `admin-form-client.ts` (`sendJsonForData`/`lockElement`/`messageBox`)

 * The rule above states its own premise in its own failure message: "a single
 * file this size usually means an island bundled a dependency". That premise is
 * what makes it sharp, and it is a premise about JAVASCRIPT. It has now been
 * broken twice by the same non-dependency — `admin.css`, the admin's shared
 * stylesheet — and both times the docblock had to explain that the rule did not
 * really mean this file.
 *
 * A rule that needs an essay each time it fires is measuring the wrong thing.
 * So the number is split by what the file IS:
 *
 *   - JS keeps 27,000. That is the dependency-catching number, and it stays
 *     exactly as tight as it was. Nothing about this change relaxes it.
 *   - CSS gets its own, sized to the one stylesheet every admin page shares.
 *
 * Measured after the redesign: `_astro/AdminLayout.*.css` is 39,903 B. It is
 * one file on purpose — the alternative considered and rejected in the block
 * above (two stylesheets on every admin page) costs a request and saves
 * nothing. 44,000 is measured + ~10%, wider than the surface budgets' margins
 * because a design system's stylesheet grows in vocabulary rather than in
 * features, and a 4,000 B margin here is about thirty new component rules.
 *
 * What this does NOT excuse: a stylesheet growing because 47 screens each
 * carry their own copy of the same rules. That is the Issue #552 shape in CSS,
 * and it shows up in `APP_BUDGET_BYTES`, not here.
 *
 * **Raised to 52,000 on 21 September 2026 (awcms-one#170)** for the same
 * reason `APP_BUDGET_BYTES` was raised alongside it: the dark sidebar tokens
 * and eight new shared primitives this file gained are vocabulary, not
 * duplication (see that constant's docblock for the full accounting).

 * ADR-0120 — the typeface, budgeted separately from everything else.

 * nothing is excluded, that "no fonts are shipped". That is no longer true, and
 * the honest response is a budget rather than a silent exclusion — which is
 * exactly what that section asked for: "the right response is a deliberate
 * exclusion recorded here, not a silent one."
 *
 * ## Why not just count them in `APP_BUDGET_BYTES`
 *
 * Because that budget measures a specific thing, and it says so: "it keeps the
 * old total's job of catching slow growth one admin screen at a time". 104,004 B
 * of fonts inside a 193,500 B ceiling would leave ~89,000 B for a surface
 * currently at ~211,000 — i.e. the budget would have to roughly double, and a
 * doubled ceiling detects nothing. One 104 KB step change would have destroyed
 * the instrument that catches 600 B steps.
 *
 * The two also behave differently in ways that matter to the premise. App JS/CSS
 * grows monotonically, one screen at a time, invisibly. A typeface is chosen
 * once, is `unicode-range`-gated so most of it is conditional, and is cached
 * across every page of every visit. They are not the same kind of weight and one
 * number cannot mean both.
 *
 * ## Measured
 *
 * ```
 * public-sans-latin.woff2          26,832 B   always
 * public-sans-latin-ext.woff2      18,472 B   conditional (unicode-range)
 * public-sans-italic-latin.woff2   15,644 B   conditional (italic text only)
 * jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2       31,432 B   always

 * family. Adding a third typeface should have to argue for itself here.
