/**
 * Metrics port (Issue #698, epic #679 platform-hardening — "operational
 * proof" wave). Complements, does NOT replace, the structured logger
 * (`src/lib/logging/logger.ts`, Issue #447) or the audit trail
 * (`src/modules/logging/application/audit-log.ts`, doc 10): those two record
 * discrete, per-event, high-detail facts (what happened, to whom, when, with
 * what free-text detail). This module records low-cardinality numeric
 * AGGREGATES (how many, how fast, how saturated) meant to be scraped/pushed
 * to a time-series backend at a fixed, small cost regardless of traffic
 * volume — a different concept, not a rename of logging.
 *
 * Same extension-point shape as `setLogSink`/`getLogSink`
 * (`src/lib/logging/logger.ts`): the default adapter is a total no-op (zero
 * I/O, zero allocation beyond a couple of object literals), so every
 * offline/LAN deployment that never calls `setMetricsPort` pays no runtime
 * cost and needs no external collector — satisfying the issue's "Offline/LAN
 * operation works with no external collector" guardrail by construction. A
 * deployment registers its own adapter (Prometheus text exposition,
 * OpenTelemetry, anything else) via `setMetricsPort`; see
 * `./adapters/prometheus-text-adapter.ts` for a worked, dependency-free
 * example.
 *
 * Guardrails (Issue #698 issue body, non-negotiable):
 * - No tenant IDs, unbounded-ID routes, email/IP, object keys, tokens,
 *   prompts, or conversation content in ANY label, ever.
 * - Every metric this codebase emits is declared in `METRIC_DEFINITIONS`
 *   below with its full label set, an `approxCardinality` estimate, and a
 *   `privacyNote` — this is the "documented cardinality and privacy review"
 *   the issue's first acceptance criterion asks for. `MetricName` is a
 *   compile-time union derived from this registry's keys, so a call site
 *   CANNOT emit an undeclared metric name — adding one always means adding a
 *   reviewed `METRIC_DEFINITIONS` entry first, never an ad hoc string at a
 *   call site.
 * - `recordCounter`/`recordHistogram`/`recordGauge` are the ONLY way
 *   application code emits metrics — never call a registered `MetricsPort`
 *   adapter directly. They silently DROP any label key not declared in that
 *   metric's `allowedLabelKeys` (defense in depth: even a future call-site
 *   bug that tries to pass, say, a raw path or an id can never actually
 *   reach an adapter) and never let an adapter's own thrown error escape —
 *   mirroring `log()`'s sink-error containment in `logger.ts` — so a broken
 *   or slow third-party adapter can never break request/job processing.
 * - Metrics are NEVER an authorization source — nothing in this module (or
 *   anything that calls it) may read a metric value to make an ABAC/RLS/
 *   authentication decision.
