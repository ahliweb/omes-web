/**
 * The same stable traversal as {@link listBlogPostsPage}, but returning FULL
 * posts instead of summaries — the shape the OpenAPI contract calls `BlogPost`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A static-site build needs every published post WITH its body: `contentJson`,
 * `excerpt`, `metaDescription`, `canonicalUrl`, and `translationGroupId`. The
 * summary traversal carries none of those, so the only way to build a site was
 * to walk the list and then fetch every post again by id — N+1 requests per
 * build, against an admin endpoint, on every publish.
 *
 * Worse, nothing said so. The contract documented this endpoint as returning
 * `BlogPost`, the implementation returned a summary, and a client that trusted
 * the contract read `contentJson` as `undefined` — producing a site that built
 * green with every article body empty, and (because the section an article
 * belongs to also lives inside `contentJson`) every section empty too. That is
 * the defect this closes, and the reason the summary shape is now spelled out
 * in the contract as its own schema instead of being left to be inferred.
 *
 * The projection is identical to `fetchBlogPostById`'s, `termIds` and
 * `institutionIds` included.
 *
 * ## Why the classifications are here now (Issue #597 item 1)
 *
 * They were left out, and the reason recorded here was that they are "a second
 * query each, which would put the N+1 straight back". The premise was right —
 * `fetchPostTermIds` takes one post — and the conclusion did not follow: a page
 * of fifty posts needs ONE query holding fifty ids, which is what
 * `fetchPostTermIdsForPosts` is. Three round trips per page, not fifty-one.
 *
 * What the omission cost was not performance. `awcms-astro` builds its sections
 * from a key inside `contentJson`, because the classification a newsroom
 * actually files an article under was the one thing this feed did not carry —
 * so no consumer could build a category or tag archive at all, which is exactly
 * the first item Issue #597 lists. Every write path has accepted `termIds`
 * since Issue #539 and the detail endpoint has returned them the whole time;
 * only the traversal that a static site is built from could not see them.
 *
 * A post with no assignments gets `[]`, never `undefined`. "This article has no
 * categories" and "this payload does not carry categories" are different facts,
 * and a consumer that cannot tell them apart silently drops the article from
 * every archive rather than reporting a gap.

 * Partial update; `version` is bumped on every successful write (monotonic

 *
 * ## Why `content_json` has THREE branches and not two
 *
 * ADR-0100 §4 keeps `content_json` alive as the non-body ENVELOPE precisely
 * because `ahliweb/awcms-astro` stores a sidecar in it — `awcmsAstro.kategori`,
 * which ADR-0115 §2 then turned into a written contract that
 * `blog:legacy:import` populates from `--section-map`.
 *
 * This function used to have two branches, and a **body-only** PATCH took the
 * projection branch with `input.contentJson === undefined`. `withProjectedBlocks`
 * spreads a non-object envelope to `{}`, so the row came back holding `blocks`
 * and nothing else: **the sidecar was destroyed on every save.** The admin edit
 * screen is exactly that caller — `admin/blog.astro` sends `bodyPortableText`
 * and has never sent `contentJson`.
 *
 * Nothing failed, and that is the whole shape of it. The article still renders
 * perfectly HERE, because `/blog/{code}/{slug}` reads `body_portable_text`. What
 * breaks is in the other repo, where `getArticles` keeps a post only when the
 * sidecar names a configured tab — so the article silently stops being BUILT.
 * Green build, no page, no warning on either side.
 *
 * The projection is therefore merged onto the STORED envelope, and merged **in
 * SQL** rather than by reading the row first: a read-modify-write would race
 * with a concurrent update of the same envelope, and `jsonb_set` cannot.
 *
 * `blog-page-directory.ts` carries the identical three branches. No consumer
 * stores a sidecar on a page today, so that half repairs nothing currently
 * broken — but a twin that keeps its sibling's defect is how the defect returns.

 * URLs that have the inbound links worth preserving.
 *
 * `pathTemplate` carries `{legacyId}` and `{slug}` because the legacy URL shape
 * belongs to the system being migrated FROM — SeputarBorneo served
 * `/news/{id_ber}_{slug}.html`, the next archive will serve something else, and
 * hard-coding one of them here would make the second migration a code change.
 *
 * Only posts this deployment would actually SERVE to an anonymous reader: a
 * redirect pointing at anything else sends a search engine to a 404, which is
 * worse than the 404 it already had.
 *
 * That sentence used to read "only PUBLISHED, non-deleted posts", over a
 * predicate that was exactly those two things — and the route that serves the
 * target requires four (`fetchPublicBlogPostBySlug`:
 * `status = 'published' AND visibility IN ('public','unlisted') AND deleted_at
 * IS NULL AND published_at IS NOT NULL AND published_at <= now()`). So a
 * `private` post and a future-dated one each got a rule whose destination
 * answers 404 — the failure the paragraph names, produced by the paragraph's
 * own function. The predicate below is now the route's, and the two are held
 * together by an integration test rather than by these two comments agreeing.
 *
 * ## The target carries a LOCALE prefix (Issue #599 follow-up)
 *
 * ADR-0098 made `/blog/{code}/{slug}` a locale-prefixed surface. This function
 * originally emitted the bare path, which a reader would have been redirected
 * to and then redirected AGAIN onto the prefixed canonical — a two-hop chain,
 * which is exactly what this issue's own acceptance criterion forbids (PRD
 * §9.2). The prefix comes from the POST's own locale, because a legacy article
 * was written in one language and the redirect knows which.
 *
 * A post whose stored locale is not one this deployment supports falls back to
 * the bare path rather than inventing a prefix for a language that has no
 * routes: a one-hop redirect to a path that then normalizes is still better
 * than a confident redirect into nothing.
