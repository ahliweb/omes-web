/**
 * The four consumer read endpoints (Issue #594) — the ones `ahliweb/awcms-astro`
 * calls to render a homepage, an ad slot and a static page.
 *
 * ## What is actually at risk here
 *
 * Not the shape of the JSON. Two things:
 *
 * 1. **That none of them is anonymous.** ADR-0102 settled that "public read"
 *    in this family means the public site's BUILDER authenticates, and
 *    `api-spec-check`'s `ALLOWED_PUBLIC_OPERATIONS` is the list that would have
 *    to name an operation for it to be otherwise. A route that acquired
 *    `security: []` would publish a curated front page before it is a front
 *    page, and an unpublished static page along with it.
 * 2. **That each of them reads the PUBLIC predicate.** The admin list functions
 *    return `private` and `unlisted` rows because an editor needs to see them.
 *    A consumer endpoint reaching for one would publish every private page the
 *    newsroom has, and nothing would report an error — the failure is silent on
 *    both sides of the wire.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network.
