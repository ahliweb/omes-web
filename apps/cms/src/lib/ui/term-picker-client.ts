/**
 * The term picker's data half (Issue #595).
 *
 * `POST`/`PATCH /api/v1/blog/posts` have accepted `termIds` since Issue #539,
 * and no screen has ever sent one — so every article published with no
 * category, no channel and no topic, and `sql/131` split those into real
 * vocabularies that nothing could assign.
 *
 * ## Why this needs no new gate on `/admin/blog`
 *
 * The page header used to state the blocker like this: "a picker needs the
 * taxonomy catalogue, and reading it under this screen's `posts.*` gates would
 * be a read with no permission of its own".
 *
 * That is true of a SERVER-side read, and it is why the header pinned the
 * screen to eleven keys. It is not true of a browser fetch against
 * `GET /api/v1/blog/terms`, which enforces `blog_content.taxonomies.read`
 * itself — the same resolution the media picker reached in the same issue.
 * Authority stays with the endpoint, the eleven-key contract is untouched, and
 * an editor without `taxonomies.read` is told so rather than shown an empty
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * ## Grouped by vocabulary, because they are four different questions
 *
 * `sql/131` made `category`, `tag`, `channel` and `topic` distinct types
 * precisely so "which channel" and "which topic" stop being one string. A flat
 * list of every term would hand that distinction straight back — an editor
 * would pick two channels and no topic without the form ever suggesting
 * otherwise.
