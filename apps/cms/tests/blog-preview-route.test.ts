/**
 * The editor preview (Issue #592).
 *
 * ## What is at risk
 *
 * 1. **That it is not a second renderer.** The issue is explicit: a preview that
 *    re-implements the template will drift, and a preview that lies is worse
 *    than no preview, because an editor trusts it and ships the difference.
 * 2. **That a draft cannot leak.** This route renders UNPUBLISHED content
 *    through a public template, deliberately. `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` and
 *    `Cache-Control: private, no-store` are what keep that from becoming a
 *    published article by accident, and the never-cacheable probe is what keeps
 *    a shared cache from holding one.
 * 3. **That it reads, and only reads.** A preview that could publish would be a
 *    publish button wearing a different name. The editing overlay (Issue #592's
 *    second half) did not change that: it saves through the existing
 *    `PATCH /api/v1/blog/posts/{id}`, so this file still has no write path and
 *    no second authorization decision. The overlay's own behaviour is covered
 *    in `tests/blog-preview-overlay.test.ts`.
 *
 * Pure — no database.
