/**
 * Asymmetric worker identity — canonical serialization, Ed25519 signature
 * verification, and envelope-freshness checks for the session-
 * UNauthenticated worker endpoints (ahliweb/omes#199, ADR-0122). This is the
 * highest-risk surface `omes_control` ships: every other endpoint in this
 * module runs behind `authorizeInTransaction` (a real tenant session); these
 * four (`/worker/enroll`, `/worker/poll`, `/worker/result`,
 * `/worker/heartbeat`) authenticate the caller by proof of possession of an
 * Ed25519 private key instead.
 *
 * ## Why headers, not body fields, carry the signature/nonce/timestamp
 *
 * The vendored OMES wire schemas (`contracts/v1/worker-*.schema.json`,
 * pinned by ahliweb/omes#197) all declare `additionalProperties: false`.
 * Adding a `signature` field to the body would violate the pinned contract
 * this module validates every envelope against
 * (`domain/contracts/validateOmesContract`) — the one thing #197's own
 * README calls out as non-negotiable. The transport-level identity proof
 * therefore travels as HTTP headers, which the pinned body schemas have no
 * opinion on: `X-Omes-Worker-Signature` (base64, over the canonical string
 * below), `X-Omes-Nonce`, `X-Omes-Timestamp`. `worker-poll.request` already
 * carries `nonce`/`timestamp` IN the body (its schema commits to that
 * shape); this module additionally requires the same values duplicated in
 * headers for poll too, so ALL FOUR routes share one verification path
 * instead of two.
 *
 * ## A flagged cross-repository gap (see the PR description)
 *
 * The OMES-side reference pull worker as merged for ahliweb/omes#192
 * (`lib/omes/py/jobs/worker.py`) does not yet generate a real Ed25519
 * keypair (its `enroll_worker()` derives a fake "public key" string from a
 * SHA-256 hash of random bytes) and sends no signature/nonce/timestamp
 * headers at all. This module intentionally does NOT relax verification to
 * match that stub — the issue's own security requirements ("asymmetric
 * worker identity verification... constant-time comparison... nonce/
 * timestamp replay protection") are the contract this side must meet
 * regardless of whether the reference worker currently exercises it.
 * Bringing the OMES-side worker up to this wire shape is a necessary
 * follow-up this PR calls out explicitly rather than silently working
 * around by weakening verification here.
