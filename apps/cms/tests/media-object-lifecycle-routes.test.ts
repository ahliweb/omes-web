/**
 * ADR-0056 §B — the three media object lifecycle endpoints gate on the three
 * permissions that were seeded with no surface at all.
 *
 * This is the inverse of the usual page contract: there is no screen yet, so
 * what has to be proven is that the permissions the catalog has been handing
 * out since `sql/052` are now enforced by real guards, and enforced on the
 * SAME keys the descriptor declares. A guard naming an action nothing seeds
 * denies everyone including the owner, and the endpoint would look perfectly
 * correct in review — this repo has shipped that defect twice.
 *
 * Four things specific to this trio:
 *
 * - **`purge` deletes the registry row, never R2 bytes** (§B). A future edit
 *   that reaches for the R2 client from the route would silently make the
 *   endpoint a second writer on a bucket the reconciliation job owns.
 * - **`purge` runs inside a SAVEPOINT.** `awcms_news_portal_ad_placements`
 *   holds a hard NOT NULL FK here, and a `23503` aborts the transaction — so
 *   catching it without the savepoint turns a caller-actionable 409 into a
 *   500 at COMMIT time.
 * - **All three require `Idempotency-Key`**, unlike `cancel` beside them.
 * - **`media_library` must not import `blog_content`** to validate a delete
 *   reason, which is why the shared blog validator is duplicated rather than
 *   reused.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
