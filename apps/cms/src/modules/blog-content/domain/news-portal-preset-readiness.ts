/**
 * Readiness gate for the `news_portal_full_online_r2` module preset
 * (Issue #632, epic `news_portal` #631-#642/#649). Pure — no I/O, no
 * `process.env` reads here (same split as
 * `visitor-analytics/domain/visitor-analytics-config.ts`).
 *
 * ## Naming reconciliation #1 — no new global `DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE` var
 *
 * Issue #632's body illustrates `DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=full_online` as if it
 * were an existing/needed env var. It is neither: `grep`ing this repo
 * finds zero references outside narrative docs
 * (`docs/awcms-mini/deployment-profiles.md`). This repo's established
 * config pattern is independent, per-feature flags (`R2_ENABLED`,
 * `EMAIL_ENABLED`, `VISITOR_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, ...) — never one central
 * deployment-mode enum every module has to branch on. Introducing a new
 * global master switch here would be the first of its kind and would
 * duplicate/compete with those flags instead of composing with them.
 *
 * Instead, "full-online" for THIS preset is expressed as two new,
 * narrowly-scoped vars (`NEWS_PORTAL_ENABLED` and `NEWS_PORTAL_PROFILE`,
 * this module's own master switch + profile selector) combined with the
 * already-existing `NEWS_MEDIA_R2_ENABLED` (news-media-r2-config.ts). Three
 * independent flags that all have to agree, not one central enum.
 *
 * ## Naming reconciliation #2 — no new `BLOG_PUBLIC_ROUTE_MODE` var
 *
 * Issue #632's body also lists `BLOG_PUBLIC_ROUTE_MODE=domain_default`.
 * That string named the `blog_content` module setting `publicRouteMode`,
 * which governed the host-resolved `/news/**` family — and BOTH were removed
 * by ADR-0071 §4, which made `/news/**` `ahliweb/awcms-astro`'s vocabulary.
 * There is nothing left for that line of the issue to configure: this repo
 * serves `/blog/{tenantCode}` and nothing else, gated by
 * `legacyTenantRouteEnabled`. What remains recommended (documented, not
 * enforced via a new mechanism) is that a tenant activating
 * `news_portal_full_online_r2` sets the relevant
 * `awcms_tenant_domains` row's existing `route_mode` column
 * (`tenant-domain/domain/tenant-domain-validation.ts`,
 * `canonical` | `legacy_blog`, Issue #557) to `"canonical"` via the
 * existing tenant-domain API (#562) — two already-existing, independent
 * mechanisms, not a third new one.
 *
 * `BLOG_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` in the issue body is, similarly, just
 * `PUBLIC_CANONICAL_BASE_PATH` (Issue #556,
 * `blog-content/application/public-route-settings.ts`), already
 * defaulting to `/news` — no new var needed for it either.
