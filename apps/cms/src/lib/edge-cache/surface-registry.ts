/**
 * The allow-list of public surfaces that may be cached at the edge — ADR-0042 §5.
 *
 * This registry is the *entire* answer to "what is cacheable". If a path is not
 * matched here it is never cached, no matter how public it looks. Adding an
 * entry is a deliberate, reviewable act; forgetting to add one costs performance
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why these, and pointedly not the others
 *
 * Included are the anonymous, tenant-scoped, content-derived GET surfaces whose
 * bodies are a pure function of published content plus tenant configuration —
 * exactly the responses that today re-run the same database work for every
 * visitor, which is what ADR-0042 exists to stop.
 *
 * Excluded, each for a specific reason rather than by oversight:
 *
 * - **`/search` and `/blog/{tenantCode}/search`** — the response varies on a
 *   free-text query. The key space is unbounded, so caching them converts a
 *   cheap request into cache-fill pressure and lets a stranger evict the useful
 *   entries by walking random queries. Site search has its own index; that is
 *   the right place to make it fast.
 * - **`/theming/preview/{token}` and `/theming/preview-tokens/{token}.css`** —
 *   the URL carries a bearer token for unpublished theme state. Caching
 *   token-scoped previews at a shared edge is precisely the disclosure this
 *   subsystem must not create.
 * - **`/login`** — authentication surface; it also sets cookies, so
 *   `decideCacheability` would refuse it anyway. Belt and braces.
 * - **`/[...path]`** — the catch-all that resolves `seo_distribution` redirects
 *   and records 404 observations. Caching it would both suppress the 404
 *   observation (a product feature) and hold a redirect that an editor has since
 *   changed. Left to the origin on purpose.
 * - **Every `/api/v1/**` route** — including the six unauthenticated ones.
 *   `analyticsCollect` is a write, and the search endpoints are query-driven.
 *   The public comments list is a genuine candidate and is a documented
 *   follow-up, not an omission.
 *
 * ## Host-resolved surfaces (ADR-0061)
 *
 * The root discovery routes (ADR-0038) resolve their tenant from the request
 * rather than from a path segment, so middleware cannot derive it from the URL
 * and source (2) in `tenant-key.ts` does not apply. They publish
 * `locals.edgeCacheTenantId` instead, via `publishEdgeCacheTenant`, and only on
 * the path that actually serves the resource; see that file for why the timing
 * of the publish is a disclosure question rather than a style question.
 *
 * ADR-0061 declared a SECOND host-resolved family here — the `/news/**` content
 * routes ADR-0059 built. [ADR-0071](../../../docs/adr/0071-kosakata-url-publik-dibelah-blog-di-sini-news-di-awcms-astro.md)
 * then removed those routes from this repo entirely (`/news/**` is
 * `awcms-astro`'s vocabulary), and the three `news-*` entries outlived them by
 * several days. They were INERT rather than dangerous — nothing served those
 * paths, and `requiresTenant` made an unpublished tenant fail closed — but an
 * inert entry is worse than no entry: it is a declaration that a shared cache
 * MAY store something, kept alive with a rationale explaining why it is safe,
 * for a route nobody can read. `edge-cache:surfaces:check` now refuses a
 * surface whose owning module declares no route that could serve it.
 *
 * Two properties had to hold before these entries were safe, and both are
 * asserted rather than assumed:
 *
 * - **The edge keys on `Host`.** `/sitemap.xml` is the same path for every
 *   tenant, so a cache that keys on path alone would serve one tenant's entire
 *   URL inventory to another's visitors. `infra/varnish/default.vcl`'s `vcl_hash` hashes `req.http.host`
 *   explicitly (and does not `return (lookup)`, so builtin `req.url` hashing
 *   still runs). `tests/edge-cache.test.ts` asserts both halves.
 * - **An unpublished tenant fails closed.** `requiresTenant` is true for every
 *   one of them, so any request whose tenant did not resolve — or whose route
 *   chose not to publish — is refused with `tenant_unresolved` rather than
 *   cached under a guessed key.
 *
 * ### Discovery bodies have TWO authors, and that shapes invalidation
 *
 * The `seo-*` surfaces below are owned by `seo_distribution`, which is right for
 * ownership (it owns the routes and the config that shapes them) and incomplete
 * for invalidation: their bodies are aggregated from every `seo_facts` provider,
 * so publishing a post changes `/sitemap.xml` and `/feed.xml` without touching
 * anything `seo_distribution` writes.
 *
 * A module purge tags `t:<tenant>:m:<moduleKey>`, so `blog_content`'s existing
 * publish purge cannot reach an object tagged `m:seo_distribution`. Left there,
 * `/blog/{code}/feed.xml` would be purged on publish while `/feed.xml` — the
 * same content, the host-resolved spelling — sat stale until TTL, an asymmetry
 * nothing would report. `enqueueModuleContentPurge` closes it by ALSO purging
 * the modules that declare a `consumes` dependency on the changing module and
 * own a declared surface. That is read from the module registry, so
 * `blog_content` never names `seo_distribution`; the consumer's own `consumes`
 * declaration is what wires it.
 *
 * The path-scoped blog feed and sitemap below (`/blog/{tenantCode}/feed.xml`,
 * `/blog/{tenantCode}/sitemap-blog.xml`) remain covered separately, so tenants
 * on the ADR-0009 path-scoped surface keep the caching they already had.
