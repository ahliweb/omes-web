/**
 * Surrogate-key vocabulary and BAN-expression construction — ADR-0042 §4.
 *
 * Varnish Cache (open source) has no native `Surrogate-Key` support the way a
 * commercial CDN does, so this codebase implements tagged invalidation the
 * standard way: the origin attaches a space-separated `Surrogate-Key` header,
 * the bundled VCL keeps that header on the cached object, and invalidation is a
 * `ban` on a regular expression over `obj.http.Surrogate-Key`.
 *
 * That mechanism is the reason this module is paranoid about characters.
 *
 * ## Two hazards, both handled here
 *
 * 1. **Regex injection widening a ban.** The ban expression is a regex. A key
 *    containing `.` or `|` or `.*` — say a resource id copied from user input —
 *    would silently turn a one-object invalidation into "ban everything",
 *    dumping the whole cache onto the origin. Every key is therefore restricted
 *    to `[A-Za-z0-9:._-]` at construction time (`sanitizeKeySegment`) AND every
 *    literal is escaped again at ban-expression time (`escapeForBanRegex`).
 *    Belt and braces, because these two steps can be reached independently.
 * 2. **Prefix collisions widening a ban.** A naive ban on `t:abc` also matches
 *    the key `t:abcdef` — a different tenant. Keys are matched with explicit
 *    whitespace-or-anchor boundaries (`(^|[[:space:]])key([[:space:]]|$)`) so
 *    one tenant can never flush another's cache by having an id that happens to
 *    be a prefix.
 *
 * Both hazards are cross-tenant, which is why the sanitizer REJECTS rather than
 * silently rewriting: a key that cannot be represented safely must not become a
 * different, still-valid key pointing at someone else's content.

/**
 * Build the ban expression for one key.
 *
 * ## Why `[[:space:]]` and not a literal space
 *
 * Varnish parses a ban expression by splitting it on **whitespace** into
 * `<field> <operator> <argument>` triplets. A literal space anywhere in the
 * regex — including inside `(^| )` — therefore produces the wrong token count
 * and the ban is rejected with `Wrong number of arguments`.
 *
 * The original form of this expression used `(^| )`/`( |$)` and was rejected
 * every single time. Nothing surfaced it: the VCL's BAN handler still returned
 * `200`, so `sendEdgeCachePurge` recorded success, the purge row was marked
 * done, and the object stayed in cache until its TTL expired. Invalidation had
 * simply never worked. It was caught only by putting Varnish in front of
 * staging and watching `X-Cache` stay `HIT` after a purge.
 *
 * `[[:space:]]` is the same boundary with no literal space in it, so the
 * expression survives the tokenizer. The boundaries themselves are load-bearing
 * (see the prefix-collision hazard above) — do not "simplify" them away, and do
 * not reintroduce a bare space.
 *
 * Quoting the regex does NOT fix it: the tokenizer splits before any quote
 * handling, so `~ "(^| )x( |$)"` fails identically. Verified against Varnish
 * 7.5.
 *
 * This must stay byte-compatible with the `ban(...)` call in
 * `infra/varnish/default.vcl`; `tests/edge-cache.test.ts` asserts both.
