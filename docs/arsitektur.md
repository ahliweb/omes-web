# Architecture

What this repository actually deploys today, and the boundaries that keep its two halves from quietly growing into each other — as it exists in the merged tree, not as it was planned. See [`docs/status.md`](status.md) for the current-state summary this document's own detail backs up, and [`README.md`](../README.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for the workspace layout and working rules this document assumes.

## Two deployables, one build-time data flow, one anonymous runtime seam

| | `apps/cms` | `apps/storefront` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | `ahliweb/awcms` v10.3.0, embedded whole via `git subtree` (see [ADR-0001](adr/0001-git-subtree-with-full-history-for-apps-cms.md)) | An Astro app, `output: "static"`, no `prerender = false` route anywhere (see [ADR-0002](adr/0002-static-output-with-build-time-fetch-for-the-storefront.md), amended by [ADR-0007](adr/0007-cart-and-checkout-stay-static-the-browser-calls-anonymous-commerce-endpoints.md)) |
| Role | The system of record — PostgreSQL under row-level security, the owner-facing commerce API, and a second, anonymous commerce API for guest shoppers | The public catalog, news, and shopping site |
| Talks to | Its own PostgreSQL database, at request time | `apps/cms`'s owner API at **build** time only (server-side, read-only token); `apps/cms`'s anonymous storefront API at **runtime**, but only from the **reader's own browser** — never from the running container |
| Runtime credential | Database connection strings for `awcms_app`/`awcms_worker`/`awcms_setup` (see `apps/cms/.env.example`) | None — `apps/storefront/server/penyaji.mjs` reads only `PORT`/`HOST`; the browser's calls to `apps/cms` carry no cookie and no bearer token (`mode: "cors"`, `credentials: "omit"`) |
| Served by | `apps/cms`'s own Bun/Astro runtime | `apps/storefront/server/penyaji.mjs`, a hand-written Bun HTTP server wrapping `@astrojs/node`'s `standalone` adapter |

**The container running `apps/storefront` never talks to `apps/cms`.** `astro build` calls `apps/cms`'s owner API once, with a read-only Bearer token (`AWCMS_API_TOKEN`), to bake the catalog, news, marketing surfaces and static pages into flat HTML under `dist/client/`. Once that build finishes, `bun dist/server/penyaji.mjs` serves those files and nothing else — it holds no API token, opens no connection to `apps/cms`, and has no code path that could reach the database even if it wanted to. **What changed in increment 2 is the *browser*'s own relationship to `apps/cms`**, not the container's: cart, checkout, and order tracking are static pages whose client-side JavaScript calls `https://<cms>/api/v1/commerce/storefront/*` directly, cross-origin, using `PUBLIC_AWCMS_ORIGIN` — a build-time-baked, deliberately public value (an origin is not a secret; every media URL already reveals it). This is the whole of [ADR-0007](adr/0007-cart-and-checkout-stay-static-the-browser-calls-anonymous-commerce-endpoints.md)'s argument: a runtime credential in the *container* was rejected because `apps/cms`'s machine credentials are read-only by construction anyway (they could never create an order); the anonymous, Origin-bound endpoint family `apps/cms` already built for its newsletter/site-search/comments surfaces is the pattern reused here instead. A compromise of the storefront container still reaches no customer data, because there is none to reach from inside it — an order, a phone number, a payment instruction all travel browser ↔ CMS directly and are never logged or stored by the storefront.

**The trade-off from ADR-0002 is unchanged for everything except price and stock at the moment of adding to cart:** every catalog and news page is still only as fresh as the last build. The cart page re-quotes every line against `apps/cms` live before checkout (`POST .../storefront/cart/quote`), so a stale static price is shown and flagged, never silently charged.

## A third trust tier: anonymous → authenticated customer, still no cookie

Increment 2 gave the browser one anonymous, Origin-bound way to talk to `apps/cms` (ADR-0007). Increment 4 adds a second tier on top of it, never replacing it: a shopper who verifies an e-mail OTP gets a `customer` row (`awcms_commerce_customer_accounts`, 1:1 with `awcms_commerce_customers`) and an opaque bearer session — never a link to `awcms_principals`, the staff credential table, and never a cookie ([ADR-0016](adr/0016-customer-accounts-are-otp-verified-commerce-accounts-with-bearer-sessions.md) D1/D3). The three tiers, concretely:

| Tier | Credential | Storage | Talks to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build-time owner | `AWCMS_API_TOKEN`, Bearer | Not shipped to the browser | `/api/v1/commerce/*` and every other owner-only surface `apps/storefront` bakes into HTML |
| Anonymous shopper | None | Nothing durable — `localStorage` cart/wishlist only | `/api/v1/commerce/storefront/*`, Origin-bound, no credential at all |
| Authenticated customer | Opaque `cs_`-prefixed bearer token, `sha256:`-hashed at rest in `awcms_commerce_customer_sessions` | `localStorage` (`awcms-one:akun:v1`), 30-day sliding TTL | The same `/api/v1/commerce/storefront/account/*` family, plus an *optional* bearer on `POST orders`/`POST reviews` |

The bearer is sent as `Authorization: Bearer …`; CORS gains `authorization` in its allowed-headers list for these routes but **never** `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` — the token is never ambient authority, so there is no new CSRF surface to defend, matching the anonymous tier's own posture. `apps/storefront/src/lib/akun-sesi.ts` owns the stored `{token, expiresAt, account}` shape and fires an `akun:berubah` event on change; `apps/storefront/src/lib/akun-klien.ts` attaches the header and clears the session on any `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` it sees, so a stale or revoked token never lingers client-side. The account tables themselves — `awcms_commerce_customer_accounts`, `awcms_commerce_customer_otps`, `awcms_commerce_customer_sessions` — are tenant-scoped, `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` tables owned entirely by `commerce` (`sql/917`); see [`docs/skema-basis-data.md`](skema-basis-data.md) for their columns.

Login/registration is a 6-digit OTP delivered through the `email` module's existing outbox, under a derived template category `derived.commerce_customer_otp` seeded by migration `sql/919` (an EN+ID copy per tenant); when `EMAIL_ENABLED` is not `"true"` (or `EMAIL_PROVIDER=log`), the code goes to a `log` adapter instead so CI and local development can exercise the whole flow without mail credentials — see [`docs/cms.md`](cms.md) and [`docs/deployment.md`](deployment.md) for why those two env vars are load-bearing for login itself, not just for outbound mail generally.

  Browser->>Browser: store {token, expiresAt, account} in localStorage (akun-sesi.ts)
  Browser->>CMS: GET account/me  (Authorization: Bearer token)
  CMS-->>Browser: 200 {account}
```

A guest never loses anything by not registering: every anonymous path ADR-0007/ADR-0009 shipped is unchanged, `POST orders`/`POST reviews` still work with no `Authorization` header at all, and the two OTP endpoints are themselves anonymous (no session exists yet to check). See [`docs/api.md`](api.md) for the full endpoint table and [`docs/routing.md`](routing.md) for the `/masuk`/`/daftar`/`/akun*` pages this tier's UI lives behind.

## One storefront, three build profiles (issue #137, [ADR-0018](adr/0018-awcms-one-is-a-template-with-build-profiles-and-an-idempotent-init.md) D2/D3)

The same `apps/storefront` tree builds three different sites, decided once, at build time, by `SITE_PROFILE`: `toko` (the default — commerce + news, BjekMart's own shape, byte-for-byte what the app built before #137), `berita` (news only) and `landing` (company profile: home, static pages, contact). This is what lets this repository be a template ([ADR-0018 D1](adr/0018-awcms-one-is-a-template-with-build-profiles-and-an-idempotent-init.md), [`docs/template.md`](template.md)) without a second codebase: a derived deployment ships only the pages it needs, and an unused profile's pages are never built — not built-and-hidden.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  ENV["SITE_PROFILE (env, build time)"] --> P["src/config/profil.ts<br/>profile → groups → nav · sitemap · feeds · robots · CSP needs"]
  P --> I["integrations/profil.mjs<br/>astro:config:setup"]

  R --> B
  H --> B
  P --> C["Header · Footer · BaseLayout · robots.txt · sitemap-sources · csp.json"]
  C --> B
```

The mechanism has three parts and one rule:

1. **[`apps/storefront/src/config/profil.ts`](../apps/storefront/src/config/profil.ts)** is the single source. It reads `SITE_PROFILE` through the same `readEnv` chain as `SITE_URL` (unknown value → the build fails naming the variable; unset → `toko`), maps a profile to its page groups (`toko` = `shared`+`toko`+`berita`, `berita` = `shared`+`berita`, `landing` = `shared`), and derives from `apps/storefront/src/config/routes.ts`'s `ROUTE_GROUPS` annotation everything a consumer needs: the nav set, the search surface, footer links, sitemap sources, feeds, `robots.txt` rules, and what the CSP artifact has to read. It fetches nothing and touches no file system, so its unit test covers all three profiles in one process.
2. **[`apps/storefront/integrations/profil.mjs`](../apps/storefront/integrations/profil.mjs)** — the app's only Astro integration — turns groups into routes in `astro:config:setup`, before Astro scans `apps/storefront/src/pages/`: for every file under an active group's `src/profil/<group>/pages/**` it calls `injectRoute` with the pattern file-based routing would have derived and a project-root-relative entrypoint. An inactive group's directory is never walked, so its `getStaticPaths()` never runs and its data is never fetched — the excluded pages are absent from `dist/` by construction, which is exactly what ADR-0018 D3 rejected runtime 404 guards in favour of. It also points the `@profil/beranda` alias at the profile's home variant, so `apps/storefront/src/pages/index.astro` (shared) renders per-profile content with only one variant in the module graph.
3. **The consumers** — `Header`/`Footer`/`BaseLayout`, `robots.txt.ts`, `sitemap-sources.ts`/`sitemap-katalog.ts`, `csp.json.ts`, the server's legacy-redirect gate — read `profil.ts` and nothing else. The rule: **no file decides a group twice.** A route's group is stated once, in `ROUTE_GROUPS`; a page file's group is stated once, by the directory it lives in; `docs/template.md`'s profile matrix is the human-readable copy, and [`apps/storefront/tests/profil-integrasi.test.ts`](../apps/storefront/tests/profil-integrasi.test.ts) parses that table and fails when the tree disagrees with it.

Nothing about the static/runtime rule above changes per profile: every profile is still `output: "static"` with build-time fetch, still calls `apps/cms` anonymously from the browser where it must (the newsletter form on `berita`, the visitor beacon everywhere), and still serves through the same `penyaji.mjs`, which needs no profile flag — it derives what the build contains from `dist/` at startup, as it already did for the CSP artifact and the legacy-redirect map. The CSP derivation below reads only the content groups the profile has (product/marketing images with `toko`, article media and the YouTube facade with `berita`), while `connect-src` carries `PUBLIC_AWCMS_ORIGIN` on every profile because the beacon runs on every profile — a correction to ADR-0018's own matrix, made from the code. CI builds and smoke-tests every profile on every push ([`docs/pengujian.md`](pengujian.md), "The build-profile tier").

## The CSP is derived from content, not configured

Product photos, slider/testimonial images, and — since increment 2 — the CMS origin itself are all things a build only learns about by fetching content; a hand-maintained CSP would drift from the moment a merchandiser uploads a new image. Instead:

1. `apps/storefront/src/pages/csp.json.ts` — a page every build unconditionally prerenders — collects every image origin the build actually referenced (`img-src`) from the same memoized fetches the pages rendered from, and calls `requireAwcmsOrigin()` (`apps/storefront/src/lib/awcms/toko-origin.ts`) to add exactly one `connect-src` origin: `PUBLIC_AWCMS_ORIGIN`. An unset or malformed value **fails the build**, naming the variable — not a runtime surprise.
2. The result is written to `dist/client/csp.json` (`{ version: 1, imgSrc: [...], connectSrc: [...] }`).
3. `apps/storefront/server/penyaji.mjs` reads that file **once, at server startup** (not per-request), and re-validates every origin independently of the build that produced it — rejecting anything with a path, query, credential, wildcard, or separator character, keeping only a bare `http(s)` origin. A missing, malformed, or unknown-version artifact falls back to the baseline policy (`img-src 'self'`, `connect-src 'self'`): images and the storefront API stop working, visibly, rather than the policy silently widening past what any build actually asked for.

This is the same mechanism for every directive — `connect-src`'s `PUBLIC_AWCMS_ORIGIN` entry (issue #30) reuses the `img-src` derivation issue #27 built, rather than adding a second configuration surface.

Increment 3 extended the same derivation rather than replacing it ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-storefront-media-resolves-through-the-media-objects-endpoint.md)): `img-src` now also carries the origin of every media URL the build actually **resolved** through `GET /api/v1/media/objects` — so a row still pointing at a previous media host renders instead of being blocked — plus `https://i.ytimg.com`, and `frame-src https://www.youtube-nocookie.com`, but only when the build really contains a video post. GA4's own origins (`script-src`/`connect-src`/`img-src`) appear only when `PUBLIC_GA_ID` is set; a default build has no third-party origin in its policy at all ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-first-party-visitor-analytics-with-an-opt-in-ga4-switch.md)).

## Import direction: one way, `storefront → kontrak → cms`

`apps/storefront` never imports from `apps/cms` directly. `packages/kontrak` sits between them, re-exporting type-only unions (`ProductType`, `ProductStatus`, `SizeChartType`, `SubscriptionPeriod`, `ServiceFormFieldType`, `ProductSort`, and the marketing/order unions issues #26/#29 added) from `apps/cms/src/modules/commerce/domain/*.ts` — the pure, I/O-free layer `apps/cms`'s own convention keeps clean — as `export type` only, no runtime value. The direction is mechanically enforced: [`tests/kontrak-arah-impor.test.mjs`](../tests/kontrak-arah-impor.test.mjs) scans every `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.astro` file under `apps/cms/src/` and fails if any of them imports from `apps/storefront`, `packages/kontrak`, or an `@awcms-one/*` package. See [ADR-0004](adr/0004-a-type-only-contract-package-with-an-import-direction-gate.md) for why this direction matters specifically because `apps/cms` is vendored code.

## The subtree embed, in brief

`apps/cms` is `ahliweb/awcms`'s own tree, carried here with full commit history via `git subtree` rather than depended on as a package — the shared infrastructure `commerce` needs (`withTenant`, `authorizeInTransaction`, `appendDomainEvent`, `recordAuditEvent`, the module contract, the migration runner) has no standalone package to depend on instead. Sync is `git subtree pull --prefix=apps/cms awcms main`, and **a PR that runs it must be merged with a merge commit — never squashed, never rebased** — squashing destroys the merge base the next sync needs, invisibly, until the next sync fails far from the commit that broke it. See [ADR-0001](adr/0001-git-subtree-with-full-history-for-apps-cms.md) for the full comparison against `--squash` and a vendored copy, and [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#the-subtree-embed) for the sync mechanics.

**Admitting the `commerce` module touched 29 files outside its own module directory** — every one of them a registry a new module must join, or a generated inventory that re-derives from source, or a small module-count bump in prose documentation. Increment 2 kept the module count at one rather than three specifically to avoid paying that 29-file cost repeatedly — see [ADR-0008](adr/0008-one-commerce-module-carries-the-whole-store-not-three.md). **After every subtree sync, the fix is to re-run the generators `bun run check` inside `apps/cms` names — never to hand-merge a generated file.**

## The `commerce` module: one module, three areas, a dependency on `media_library`

Per [ADR-0008](adr/0008-one-commerce-module-carries-the-whole-store-not-three.md), all commerce tables, routes, permissions, events, jobs and admin screens live under the single module key `commerce`, grouped internally by area (`domain/{catalog,marketing,orders}/…` is a directory convention, not a module boundary):

- **Catalog** (issue #23) — categories, products (images, variants, tiered pricing, size charts, service forms, promo banners).
- **Marketing** (issue #26) — flash sales, vouchers, sliders, testimonials, a popup, versioned store settings.
- **Orders** (issue #29) — customers, addresses, cart quoting, orders, payment confirmations, reviews, wishlists, and the anonymous `/api/v1/commerce/storefront/*` surface.
- **Customer accounts and affiliates** (issue #32) — OTP-verified accounts, bearer sessions, and the affiliate program ([ADR-0016](adr/0016-customer-accounts-are-otp-verified-commerce-accounts-with-bearer-sessions.md)).
- **External providers, POS, reports, inbox, campaigns, and feature toggles** (issue #33, [ADR-0017](adr/0017-external-providers-are-commerce-owned-ports-with-env-credentials-and-token-addressed-webhooks.md)) — RajaOngkir courier rates, a WhatsApp outbox and OTP channel, a Midtrans payment gateway with public webhook intake and reconciliation, in-store POS sales (`orders.channel`, `payment_method = cash`), `reporting`-projection sales reports, a customer inbox, consent-gated marketing campaigns, and per-tenant feature toggles plus tiered pricing at quote — see "External providers" below.

`module.ts`'s `dependencies` are `tenant_admin`, `identity_access`, `domain_event_runtime`, `media_library` (product/slider/testimonial/popup images resolve through `MediaLibraryPort`), and `module_management` (the anonymous storefront tenant-resolver's fail-closed check). See [`docs/skema-basis-data.md`](skema-basis-data.md), [`docs/kamus-data.md`](kamus-data.md), [`docs/api.md`](api.md), and [`docs/cms.md`](cms.md) for the module's contents in depth, and [`apps/cms/src/modules/commerce/README.md`](../apps/cms/src/modules/commerce/README.md) for its own, code-adjacent documentation.

## External providers: ports and outboxes inside `commerce`, never a synchronous call on the order path

Increment 5 (epic [#33](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-one/issues/33)) added `commerce`'s first external HTTP integrations — a courier-rate aggregator (RajaOngkir), a WhatsApp sender (Fonnte/Meta Cloud API), and a payment gateway (Midtrans Snap). [ADR-0017](adr/0017-external-providers-are-commerce-owned-ports-with-env-credentials-and-token-addressed-webhooks.md) (D1) settled the shape once, and every one of the three follows it: a small port interface, one or more adapters selected by an env var, a `log` adapter for dev/CI, `withTimeout` plus `getProviderCircuitBreaker`, and — for anything the order path depends on — an outbox table so the provider call never happens inside the database transaction that changes order state (this is the same discipline [ADR-0010](adr/0010-manual-payment-and-alternative-courier-first-gateways-via-outbox.md) already established for payment confirmations and courier notes).

**Inbound webhooks never trust the payload for tenant identity.** A public `POST /api/v1/commerce/webhooks/{provider}/{endpointToken}` resolves `(tenant, provider)` from an opaque, hashed per-tenant token via a `SECURITY DEFINER` bootstrap function modelled on `awcms_resolve_tenant_domain_lookup` — a webhook body claiming a `tenant_id` would be an unverified oracle, per ADR-0017 D2's own rejected-alternatives table. Replay protection is a `UNIQUE (tenant_id, provider, event_key)` constraint on `awcms_commerce_payment_events`, so a provider's at-least-once delivery is idempotent: a replayed event still answers `200`, just without a second side effect. An amount mismatch between the webhook's `gross_amount` and the order's own total is recorded (`outcome = 'amount_mismatch'`) but never marks the order paid — `sql/934` added that guard after #110 shipped, closing the gap #113 flagged. Because webhooks can be dropped in transit, `commerce:payments:reconcile` polls every still-`pending`/`created` gateway session's `fetchStatus` on its own schedule — the same `markOrderPaidBySystem` path the webhook handler uses, so a lost webhook self-heals within the job's own interval rather than stranding an order in `pending_payment` forever.

## One more thing the server does: it repairs a shadowed page

`apps/storefront/server/penyaji.mjs` is still a static file server with no API token, but it now performs one internal rewrite beyond the two redirect layers: under `build.format: "file"` a landing page that also has children is emitted as a file **beside** a directory of the same name (`berita.html` next to `berita/`), and `@astrojs/node`'s static handler rewrites the directory-shaped request to an `index.html` this build never writes — so `/berita`, `/video` and every `/rubrik/{slug}` answered 404 on the served site while every build gate was green ([issue #75](https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-one/issues/75)). The server discovers those shadowed pages once at startup and rewrites `req.url` to `{path}.html` as the **last** step before the adapter, after `/healthz`, the `/products` redirect and both legacy-redirect layers, so nothing it does can shadow a redirect. See [`docs/routing.md`](routing.md) and [ADR-0013](adr/0013-rule-based-legacy-redirects-beside-the-row-based-map.md).

## What is still not here

What [ADR-0016](adr/0016-customer-accounts-are-otp-verified-commerce-accounts-with-bearer-sessions.md) D6 deferred and increment 5 did not pick up: e-mail/phone change on an existing account, and phone verification. What [ADR-0017](adr/0017-external-providers-are-commerce-owned-ports-with-env-credentials-and-token-addressed-webhooks.md) names as explicit follow-ups behind the ports it already built: a Xendit adapter behind the same `PaymentGatewayProvider` port, and courier tracking (rates are done; tracking a shipped parcel is not). A real R2-backed upload for product images, slider media, and payment-confirmation proof images (the seed script uses self-generated placeholder SVGs and the anonymous payment-proof upload endpoint answers `503 MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE` — see [`docs/deployment.md`](deployment.md) and [`docs/cms.md`](cms.md)); a production PostgreSQL deployment (`compose.yaml`'s `postgres:18.4` is a local/CI convenience only — see [`docs/deployment.md`](deployment.md)); a database-backup admin screen (explicitly scoped out of issue #33 as an operations concern — see [`docs/deployment.md`](deployment.md)); customer push notifications (campaigns currently reach e-mail and WhatsApp only — push subscriptions are per-staff today, not per-customer).
