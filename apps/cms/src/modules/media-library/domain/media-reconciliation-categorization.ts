/**
 * Pure categorization logic for the R2 media lifecycle cleanup &
 * reconciliation job (Issue #690, epic #679 platform-hardening — "runtime/
 * worker hardening" wave, following #691/#689/#694/#695/#687/#697). No I/O
 * at all (no DB, no R2, no `process.env`) — `scripts/news-media-r2-
 * reconcile.ts`'s application-layer orchestration
 * (`news-media-reconciliation.ts`) is what gathers the inputs below (a
 * DB row snapshot via `news-media-object-directory.ts`'s fetch helpers, and
 * an R2 bucket listing via `news-media-r2-client.ts`'s paginated
 * `listObjects`) and calls this module to decide what belongs in which
 * category. Kept pure specifically so every category boundary (the exact
 * question this job's acceptance criteria/tests care about) can be tested
 * deterministically against synthetic inputs, without a real Postgres/R2
 * fake server — same "decision logic separated from I/O" convention as
 * `news-media-finalize-decision.ts`.
 *
 * ## The five categories
 *
 * - **healthy** — an `uploaded`/`verified`/`attached` row whose object key
 *   IS present in the R2 listing. No action.
 * - **orphanInDb** — an `uploaded`/`verified`/`attached` row whose object
 *   key is MISSING from the R2 listing (the DB thinks the object should
 *   exist; R2 disagrees). REPORT-ONLY, forever — this job never mutates
 *   these rows. In particular an `attached` row may be actively referenced
 *   by published content; auto-transitioning it (e.g. to `failed`) without
 *   a human decision is exactly the kind of silent, surprising mutation
 *   this job must never perform. Remediation (re-upload, unlink, manual
 *   investigation) is an operator decision — see
 *   `docs/awcms-mini/news-portal/r2-backup-lifecycle.md`'s operator SOP
 *   section.
 * - **expiredPending** — a `pending_upload`/`uploaded`/`failed` row, not yet
 *   soft-deleted, older than `pendingTtlMinutes`
 *   (`NEWS_MEDIA_R2_PENDING_TTL_MINUTES`). Eligible for R2-object-delete +
 *   DB hard-delete (`r2-backup-lifecycle.md` §2: a row that never became a
 *   real resource). `failed` rows are included alongside
 *   `pending_upload`/`uploaded` so a previous run's R2-delete failure
 *   (provider outage) is retried on the next run — see this module's own
 *   idempotency note below.
 * There is deliberately NO "stale orphaned" category (finding D16). One used
 * to sit here, matching `status = 'orphaned'` rows past a grace period — and
 * `markNewsMediaObjectOrphaned` was the repo's only writer of that status and
 * had zero callers, so it matched a permanently empty set. A zero counter and
 * a clean bucket printed the same line. The status itself is a leftover of the
 * pre-ADR-0036 model: `sql/087` removed the attach/detach relation, so no
 * reference count exists to derive "orphaned" FROM. `orphanGraceDays` survives
 * because `orphanInR2` below genuinely uses it.
 * - **orphanInR2** — an R2 object whose key has NO matching DB row AT ALL
 *   (any status, any `deletedAt`) for this tenant. Eligible for physical R2
 *   deletion once its OWN age (R2's reported `lastModified`, the only
 *   timestamp available — there is no DB row) exceeds `orphanGraceDays`.
 *   This category only exists because `purgeNewsMediaObject` (hard delete)
 *   does not itself delete the R2 object — a known, accepted gap this job
 *   closes asynchronously rather than by changing that endpoint's
 *   transaction semantics (ADR-0006: R2 calls never happen inside a DB
 *   transaction, and purge's own request/response cycle is not the place
 *   to add a synchronous cross-provider call). An object without a
 *   `lastModified` (should not happen in practice) is conservatively never
 *   included — this job would rather leave a truly-ancient untracked object
 *   alone than mis-delete based on missing metadata.
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 *
 * Categorizing the SAME snapshot twice always produces the SAME four lists
 * — this function has no side effects and no hidden state. Real-world
 * idempotency across ACTUAL job runs (`bun run news-media:reconcile` twice
 * in a row doing nothing the second time) additionally depends on the
 * application layer's mutations actually converging (deleting a row/object
 * removes it from the NEXT run's candidate snapshot) — see
 * `news-media-reconciliation.ts`'s own header for that half of the
 * guarantee.
 *
 * ## The race-condition guarantee (critical acceptance criterion)
 *
 * This module's OWN output is never itself unsafe to act on for
 * `orphanInR2` MERELY because it's a point-in-time snapshot — the
 * application layer (not this file) is responsible for re-verifying each
 * `orphanInR2` candidate immediately before deleting it
 * (`objectKeyExistsForTenant`, a targeted point lookup, NOT this bulk
 * categorization) to close the window between "when this snapshot was
 * taken" and "when the delete actually happens". This module cannot, by
 * itself, guarantee that — it only guarantees that a snapshot which
 * genuinely had no matching DB row at scan time is correctly categorized as
 * `orphanInR2`, nothing about what happens microseconds later.
