/**
 * `bun run db:work-class:generate` — Issue #263.
 *
 * Snapshots which work class every API route and every worker/setup job is
 * classified as, into `docs/awcms/work-class-registry.generated.json`.
 * `db:work-class:check` regenerates in memory and diffs, so a new or
 * reclassified route/job cannot merge without a reviewable diff to that file.
 *
 * ## Why this exists now
 *
 * The JSON has been in the repo since it was copied from awcms-mini, with NO
 * generator and NO check behind it — the design was specified in
 * `docs/awcms/database-capacity-runbook.md` §CI drift gate and never built. It
 * therefore listed 284 awcms-mini routes, most of them ghosts, while claiming
 * in its own `_disclaimer` to describe "96 real routes" in a repo that has 221.
 *
 * A `.generated` suffix is a claim: derived from code, do not hand-edit. That
 * makes such a file MORE trusted than ordinary prose, which is exactly why one
 * with nothing behind it is worse than no file at all — and it was already
 * cited by the capacity runbook, the document an operator reads when sizing the
 * pool.
 *
 * ## Two halves, two sources of truth
 *
 * **Routes are generated**, because every route already declares its work class
 * inline — through `defineTenantRoute({ workClass })` (Issue #255, where it is
 * a compile error to omit) or through `withTenant(..., { workClass })`, or by
 * relying on the documented `"interactive"` default. Generating from that is
 * strictly more reliable than a second hand-maintained copy.
 *
 * Recognising `defineTenantRoute` is not optional. Without it, every route
 * migrated to the factory would silently VANISH from the snapshot — the exact
 * regression awcms-micro hit when it migrated its first module.
 *
 * **Jobs are declared**, in `src/lib/database/work-class-registry.ts`. Worker
 * scripts never call `withTenant`, so there is nothing to generate from. The
 * generator instead discovers them by ground truth (`getWorkerDatabaseClient(`
 * / `getSetupDatabaseClient(` in `scripts/*.ts`) and REFUSES TO RUN when the
 * declared map and reality disagree — refusing to generate, not just to check,
 * is the behaviour that file's own header specifies.

 * `site-search-reconcile.ts` passed `maintenance` where the registry says
 * `background_sync` — which is what makes this a two-sided check rather than a

 *
 * ## What this can and cannot see, stated because a gate that implies more is
 * worse than one that implies less
 *
 * It reads ONE file: the script. A script whose transactions live in a job
 * module under `src/` has no `withTenant*(` call of its own, so `calls` is 0
 * and nothing here is asserted about it — several registry rationales say
 * "every call inside <module> already passes it explicitly", and this gate is
 * not the thing that verifies those. What it does cover exactly is the shape
 * the finding had: a call in the script itself, with no class or with the
 * wrong one.
 *
 * Counting is what catches the partial case. A script with three calls and one
 * literal looks declared to any presence check, and two of its transactions
 * still run as `interactive`.
