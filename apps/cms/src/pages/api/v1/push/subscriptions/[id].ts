/**
 * `DELETE /api/v1/push/subscriptions/{id}` (Issue #466) — the caller retires
 * one of their OWN devices.
 *
 * Self-service for the same reason registration is (see `./index.ts`): the
 * subject is the caller, and ownership is expressed by matching
 * `tenant_user_id` inside the UPDATE rather than by fetching a row and
 * comparing afterwards. Nothing here reads a subscription it is not allowed to
 * change, so there is no window between the check and the write.
 *
 * ## One 404 for three different things
 *
 * "No such subscription", "belongs to somebody else", and "already revoked" all
 * answer `404 SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND`. Distinguishing them would turn this
 * endpoint into an existence oracle for other people's device ids, which is the
 * anti-oracle rule `identity_access`'s admin surfaces already follow — and the
 * caller can act on none of the three differently anyway.
 *
 * The revocation itself does more than flip a status: it destroys the stored
 * endpoint. See `revokeOwnPushSubscription`.
