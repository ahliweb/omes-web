/**
 * Authenticated admin write-action E2E (Issue #171) — exercises the
 * permission-gated write controls on `/admin/users`: log in through the real
 * `/login` form → session cookies → `/admin` guard → the Users screen renders
 * the activate/deactivate + role-assignment controls (the seeded owner holds
 * `identity_access.access_control.configure` and `.assign`) → a role-assign
 * round-trips through `POST /api/v1/access/assignments` via cookie auth.
 *
 * Env-gated exactly like `admin-offices-create.e2e.ts`: the CI `e2e-smoke` job
 * seeds a tenant + owner via `POST /api/v1/setup/initialize` and hands the
 * credentials through env vars. Skipped (not failed) when they are absent.
 *
 * The single seeded user is the owner, who already holds the only role, so the
 * assertion is deliberately non-destructive: re-assigning the already-held role
 * is rejected (409) and the client surfaces the generic error — proving the
 * external CSP-safe script, `sendJson`, and the guarded endpoint all round-trip
 * without deactivating the owner (which would revoke the running session).
