/**
 * The admin sidebar model, derived from the module registry.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `ModuleDescriptor.navigation` was already consumed three ways — validated
 * for path conflicts by `module-composition.ts`, written to
 * `awcms_module_navigation` by `descriptor-sync.ts`, and served by
 * `GET /api/v1/modules` through `navigation-registry.ts` — while
 * `AdminLayout.astro` rendered a hand-maintained array that read none of it.
 *
 * Two sources, never compared, and both had rotted in opposite directions:
 * three declared entries pointed at admin pages that do not exist
 * (`/admin/blog`, two `/admin/news-portal/*`), and eight pages that DO exist
 * were unknown to the registry. The dead entries were being synced to the
 * database and served by the API as valid menu items. `comments/module.ts`
 * spelled the arrangement out honestly — "the sidebar entry is added there by
 * hand. Both must be kept in step until that subsystem exists" — which is a
 * description of drift waiting to happen, not a safeguard.
 *
 * This file is that subsystem's first half: the DEFAULT model, computed from
 * `listModules()`. Ported from awcms-micro's
 * `module-management/domain/sidebar-menu.ts`, minus the per-tenant override
 * layer (its `awcms_sidebar_menu_{types,items}` tables and admin editor are a
 * separate increment — see the module README).
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * **Not authorization.** `requiredPermission` here only decides whether a LINK
 * is drawn. Every target page and API runs its own server-side guard
 * regardless, exactly as `navigation-registry.ts` already documents. A visible
 * link grants nothing and a hidden one protects nothing.
 *
 * The entry set is trusted BUILD-TIME data: the synthetic core items below plus
 * whatever modules declare. Nothing here reads user input, so no entry can be
 * injected at runtime.

 * `labelKey` -> icon name, resolved by `src/lib/ui/admin-icons.ts` (ADR-0120).
 *
 * ## Why this table exists at all
 *
 * `ModuleDescriptor.navigation[].icon` has been in the contract, validated by
 * the composition checker, and threaded through `SidebarDefaultEntry` and
 * `ComposedEntry` since the sidebar was ported. It was also DEAD, in both
 * directions: no descriptor in each module's `module.ts` set it, and
 * `AdminLayout.astro` never read it. A field declared, validated, carried
 * through two type layers, and rendered by nothing.
 *
 * The redesign needs an icon per entry, so the honest options were to fill in
 * `icon` across 21 descriptors or to default it here. This table does the
 * latter, and the descriptor field now genuinely WINS over it (see
 * `buildDefaultSidebarModel`) — so the contract field is live rather than
 * ceremonial, without a change that touches every module to prove it.
 *
 * ## Keyed on `labelKey`, not on path or module
 *
 * `labelKey` is the identifier this file already gates for completeness in both
 * directions (`tests/admin-navigation-registry.test.ts`, and the i18n sidebar
 * test). Keying on the same thing means a new screen that forgets an icon is
 * caught by the assertion that already exists, and a retired screen cannot
 * leave an orphan here.
 *
 * A missing entry is NOT an error: `resolveAdminIcon` falls back to a neutral
 * dot. That is deliberate — an icon is decoration on a labelled link, and a
 * sidebar should never fail to render because a glyph was not chosen.

 * Per-tenant override layer (Issue #260)

 *
 * Everything above computes the DEFAULT model from the registry. What follows
 * lets a tenant reorder, hide, relabel and re-bucket that default, and add
 * custom sections.
 *
 * The security boundary is the same one this file opens with, and it is why
 * overrides are stored as a delta rather than a snapshot: the ITEM SET stays
 * trusted build-time data. A tenant can only override an entry that
 * `buildDefaultSidebarModel` already produced — `applySidebarOverrides` looks
 * every override up BY KEY against the default model and ignores anything that
 * does not match. There is no code path that turns a stored row into a new
 * link, so a malicious or corrupted write cannot inject one.
