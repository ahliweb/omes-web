/**
 * The SOURCE-tenant half of a tenant switch — ADR-0088, Gelombang 7 PR 7.4.
 *
 * A switch spans two tenants, and one `withTenant` sets exactly one tenant
 * context, so it is necessarily two transactions: read who is asking (here),
 * then enter the target (`tenant-entry.ts`, opened by `withPublicAuthTenant`).
 *
 * ## Why the openings live here rather than in the route
 *
 * `bun run api:tenant-route:check` rejects a new route file that opens its own
 * tenant transaction, and it is right to: the factory is what carries the guard
 * chain and the mandatory work class. This route cannot use the factory —
 * `defineTenantRoute` would authorize against the SOURCE tenant while the work
 * belongs to the TARGET — so the openings are named here instead, the same
 * shape `withPublicAuthTenant` took for the unauthenticated auth surfaces.
 * That is the fourth instance of an established pattern, not a way around a
 * gate.
