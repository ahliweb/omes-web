/**
 * The executor ADR-0094 deferred — Issue #557.
 *
 * `subject-data-plan.ts` decides WHICH tables a request touches and how each
 * binds to the person. This file is the part that actually talks to the
 * database, and it is deliberately the boring half: every interesting decision
 * was already made by a descriptor its owning module declared.
 *
 * ## Identifiers are interpolated, and that is not a SQL-injection hole
 *
 * Table and column names cannot be bound as parameters, so they are
 * interpolated into the statement. What makes that safe here is not escaping
 * but PROVENANCE: every identifier comes from a `SubjectDataDescriptor`
 * declared in a `module.ts` — TypeScript source, not user input — and
 * `subject-data:registry:check` has already resolved each one against `sql/`.
 * `assertSafeIdentifier` is the belt to that braces: it refuses anything that
 * is not `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`, so a descriptor that ever did carry punctuation
 * fails loudly here instead of quietly composing a statement.
 *
 * The values — the subject's ids, the tenant id — are bound, always.
 *
 * ## The tenant predicate is written explicitly, under RLS
 *
 * Every statement carries `WHERE <tenantColumn> = ${tenantId}` even though
 * FORCE RLS would enforce it anyway. That is the rule this repo already learned
 * the hard way (ADR-0087 follow-up): a script that leans on RLS alone is one
 * `SET ROLE` away from touching every tenant, and the predicate costs nothing.
