     * the "purge already-soft-deleted rows" story every OTHER descriptor
     * here tells does not apply to it at all. Its `retentionMaxDays` is
     * deliberately the widest in this file — fiscal/statutory retention,
     * not a housekeeping window — and `deletion.mode: "hard_delete"` stays
     * technically accurate only because it is, in practice, UNREACHABLE:
     * `cursorColumn: "deleted_at"` can never match a live order for the
     * same NULL-cursor reason every sibling descriptor already relies on.
     * `commerce.order_events` is the one exception in the OTHER direction:
     * an append-only audit trail with no `deleted_at` column at all, so its
     * cursor is `created_at` instead — a long window (it is evidence of
     * every state transition an order went through), never purged in
     * practice while the order it describes is still within ITS OWN
     * retention window.
