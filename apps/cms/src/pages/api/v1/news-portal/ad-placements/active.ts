/**
 * `GET /api/v1/news-portal/ad-placements/active` (Issue #594) — every slot's
 * currently-runnable creatives, already rotated and capped, for a build client
 * that renders its own markup.
 *
 * ## Why all twelve slots in one answer
 *
 * The alternative is a call per slot, and a consumer rendering a page has four
 * to seven of them. More importantly, THREE of the twelve are ones this repo's
 * own templates do not draw at all (`sidebar_*`, see
 * `domain/ad-slot-rendering.ts`) — the sidebar exists in
 * `ahliweb/awcms-astro`, not here. An endpoint shaped around what this repo
 * renders would silently withhold the inventory a consumer exists to show.
 *
 * ## Rotation happens HERE, and that is the point
 *
 * A consumer receives the SELECTION, not the pool: `selectAdsForRotation`
 * applies each slot's `rotationMode` and the preset's `maxItems` before the
 * response is built. Leaving that to the caller would mean four rotation modes
 * re-implemented in another repository, and the one that drifted would
 * over-serve a slot an advertiser paid a fixed number of impressions for.
 *
 * `random_safe`/`weighted` make this response deliberately NOT byte-stable
 * between calls. It is therefore not cacheable at the edge and does not try to
 * be — `Cache-Control` is left to the standard headers, and a build client
 * calls it once per build.
 *
 * ## `target` is a query parameter, and an invalid one is refused
 *
 * `?targetType=post&targetId=<uuid>` scopes the answer to one page: the
 * placements booked against it UNIONED with every global placement for the same
 * slot. Omitting both returns the global inventory, which is what a listing page
 * carries. A `targetType` outside the four is a 400 rather than a silent
 * fallback to `global`, because silently widening the scope of an ad query is
 * how a placement books against one article and appears on all of them.
 *
 * Guarded on `blog_content.ad_placements.read` — same "the builder
 * authenticates" decision as `GET /api/v1/site-profile/composed` (ADR-0102).
 * Media URLs here are the registry's own server-generated ones, never client
 * input; there is no free-URL column on this table at all.
