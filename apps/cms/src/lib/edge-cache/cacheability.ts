/**
 * The fail-closed cacheability decision — ADR-0042 §3. **This is the security
 * spine of the edge cache; read this before changing anything in it.**
 *
 * A shared cache in front of a multi-tenant application is, by default, a
 * cross-tenant disclosure machine: cache one authenticated admin response
 * against a URL and every subsequent anonymous visitor to that URL is served
 * another tenant's data. Nothing about Varnish prevents that. This function is
 * what prevents it, and it is the only thing that does.
 *
 * ## The shape of the guarantee
 *
 * `decideCacheability` is **pure** and **allow-list first**. A response is
 * cacheable only if it clears EVERY check below; there is no path that reaches
 * `cacheable: true` by default, by omission, or by an unrecognized input. New
 * routes are uncacheable until someone deliberately declares a surface profile
 * for them, so forgetting about this subsystem is always the safe outcome.
 *
 * The checks, in order, each with the reason it exists:
 *
 * 1. **Mode off** — subsystem disabled, nothing is ever cacheable.
 * 2. **No declared surface** — the allow-list gate. An undeclared path is never
 *    cached even if it looks public.
 * 3. **Method** — only `GET`/`HEAD`. A cached `POST` is a correctness bug.
 * 4. **`Authorization` header** — the request is authenticated; its response is
 *    per-principal by definition.
 * 5. **Identity-bearing cookie** — same reasoning, via cookies. Matched by the
 *    `awcms_` **prefix** rather than an enumerated list, so adding a new
 *    identity cookie tomorrow cannot silently open a hole. (`edge-cache`'s test
 *    suite asserts the real session/tenant cookie names still match this
 *    prefix — that is the coupling to reality.)
 * 6. **Status** — only statuses whose bodies are safe and stable to reuse.
 * 7. **`Set-Cookie` on the response** — caching this hands one visitor's cookie
 *    to everyone who follows. Non-negotiable.
 * 8. **`Cache-Control: private` / `no-store` / `no-cache`** — a route that has
 *    already declared itself uncacheable always wins over a surface profile.
 *    Route-level intent is more specific than a registry pattern.
 * 9. **`Vary: *`** — explicitly means "never reusable".
 *
 * ## What this function deliberately does NOT decide
 *
 * It does not decide the TTL's *magnitude* — that is the auto-activation ramp in
 * `pressure.ts`. Keeping the two apart is intentional: load can only ever change
 * how long something is cached, never whether a private response becomes
 * cacheable. No pressure reading can widen the allow-list.
