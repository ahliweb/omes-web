/**
 * Creates a tenant with its office, owner account, `owner` role, grants, and
 * access assignment — the whole set, in the caller's transaction.
 *
 * ## Why this is extracted (ADR-0054)
 *
 * The setup wizard and tenant provisioning both need it, and the one thing that
 * must never differ between them is the `scope` filter on the grant. A second
 * copy of this INSERT is exactly how the cross-tenant defect ADR-0052 removed
 * would come back: the copy would be written by someone reading the original,
 * which for most of this repo's life did not have the filter.
 *
 * `grantPlatformScope` is the ONLY difference between the two callers, and it
 * is a parameter rather than a branch on "is this the first tenant?" so the
 * answer is stated at the call site instead of inferred.
 *
 * ## The tenant-context switch
 *
 * Every table written below is under FORCE RLS keyed on
 * `app.current_tenant_id`, so this sets that GUC to the tenant being CREATED.
 * The caller may already be inside a different tenant's context (provisioning
 * runs as the platform tenant), so it restores the previous value before
 * returning — otherwise the caller's own audit row, idempotency record, and
 * anything else after this point would silently be written into the new
 * tenant's partition.
 *
 * Both ids are `assertUuid`-validated before interpolation; `SET LOCAL` takes
 * no bind parameters, which is why this is the one place `tx.unsafe` appears.
