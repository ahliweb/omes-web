/**
 * `visitor_analytics` — privacy-first human visitor statistics, ported from
 * awcms-micro (epic #617-#624) as a standalone, additive module. Ships: the
 * tenant-scoped session/event/rollup schema (migrations 049 permissions, 050
 * schema, 051 session-lookup index), the identity/UA/bot classification +
 * path-sanitization + salted-hashing domain helpers, the additive PUBLIC
 * visit-ingest endpoint (`POST /api/v1/analytics/collect`), the authenticated
 * `/api/v1/analytics/*` read API (ABAC-guarded), the on-demand retention
 * purge endpoint (`POST /api/v1/analytics/retention/purge`), the scheduled
 * rollup + retention-purge jobs (`bun run analytics:rollup` /
 * `analytics:purge`), and the `/admin/analytics` dashboard.
 *
 * `type: "system"` (mirrors awcms-micro, NOT `"domain"`): human visitor
 * telemetry is platform/observability infrastructure every tenant shares the
 * mechanism of (same reasoning as `reporting`/`logging`), not a tenant-facing
 * business feature. Higher volume and different retention/privacy needs than
 * `reporting`/`logging` is exactly why it is its own module.
 *
 * PORT ADAPTATIONS (documented, not silent):
 *  - COLLECTION IS A PUBLIC INGEST ENDPOINT, NOT MIDDLEWARE. awcms-micro
 *    collected via `src/middleware.ts` (observing every request). This base
 *    keeps `src/middleware.ts` UNTOUCHED (login/Turnstile/CSP guarantees
 *    unchanged) and exposes the same collector logic via an additive public
 *    beacon endpoint that resolves the tenant from the request's `tenantCode`
 *    (the RLS-free `awcms_tenants` table, ADR-0009 — same as the existing
 *    `/blog/{tenantCode}` public routes, so NO SECURITY DEFINER is needed).
 *    The beacon is anonymous-only: `identity_id`/`login_identifier_snapshot`
 *    are always null.
 *  - data_lifecycle COUPLING RE-WIRED (ADR-0037). The `data_lifecycle` module
 *    was ported to this base, so the `dataLifecycle` descriptor
 *    (`visitor_analytics.visit_events`, delegated) and the `LegalHoldGuardPort`
 *    gate are RE-ADDED. An active hold covering `visitor_analytics.visit_events`
 *    (descriptor-scoped OR tenant-wide) blocks the ENTIRE purge — events AND
 *    steps 2-4 (session raw-detail clearing, session deletion, rollup deletion).
 *    This is deliberately broader than awcms-micro (which gated only the events
 *    DELETE): steps 2-4 also destroy litigation-relevant data (IP/login
 *    snapshot, aggregates), so over-preserving under a hold is the safe default
 *    for a compliance control (`application/retention-purge.ts`).
 *  - NEWS PORTAL PRESET WIRING DEFERRED. awcms-micro's
 *    `news_portal_full_online_r2` preset enables this module. This base's
 *    `news_portal` was ported without that wiring and is NOT modified here
 *    (this module ships standalone).
 *  - NO `reporting` LIFECYCLE DEPENDENCY. awcms-micro lists `reporting` in
 *    `dependencies`, but `dependencies` governs enable/disable LIFECYCLE
 *    ORDERING only (see `_shared/module-contract.ts`) and neither micro nor
 *    this base consumes any `reporting` capability, port, table, or projection
 *    from `visitor_analytics` (no `capabilities.consumes` entry, no import).
 *    `reporting` is a conceptual PEER (both `type: "system"` observability),
 *    not a runtime prerequisite — visitor telemetry has its own schema and
 *    rollup and functions with `reporting` disabled. Declaring the edge would
 *    force `reporting` to stay enabled for no functional reason and wrongly
 *    make it a non-leaf. Dropped here (kept `tenant_admin`/`identity_access`/
 *    `logging`, which ARE used for tenant context, ABAC, and audit).

    "Privacy-first human visitor statistics for admin and public routes, in both online and offline/LAN configurations (ported from awcms-micro epic #617-#624).

Visitor identifiers (visitor-key cookie, IP, user-agent) are stored only as salted HMAC-SHA256 hashes, never raw, unless the operator explicitly opts into raw collection.

The visit_events retention purge is gated by an active data_lifecycle legal hold (ADR-0037): the dataLifecycle descriptor and LegalHoldGuardPort coupling, dropped at the original port because data_lifecycle did not exist here yet, are now RE-WIRED.
