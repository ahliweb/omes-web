# OpenAPI Contracts

The published public contract is
[`awcms-public-api.openapi.yaml`](awcms-public-api.openapi.yaml) — **do not
edit this file by hand.** Since Issue #182 (epic #177, ADR-0026) it is a
GENERATED artifact, bundled from source fragments:

- [`awcms-public-api.src.yaml`](awcms-public-api.src.yaml) — the root fragment:
  `openapi`/`info`/`servers`/`tags`/`security`, and
  `components.securitySchemes`/`parameters`/`responses`, plus any schema shared
  by 2+ modules (e.g. `ApiError`, `ApiMeta`). **The `tags` catalog here is not
  decoration**: `scripts/api-docs-generate.ts` groups the reference document by
  DECLARED tag, so an operation carrying a tag this catalog omits is dropped
  from the generated docs entirely. Four modules' surfaces (55 operations) were
  invisible that way until the tag gate below was added.
- [`modules/*.openapi.yaml`](modules/) — **one file per base module** (Issue
  #182 convention: one file = one module, not one file = one tag). Each file
  owns every `paths` entry whose operations carry that module's OpenAPI tag(s),
  plus every `components.schemas` entry referenced ONLY by that module's
  operations. `foundation.openapi.yaml` holds the truly module-less platform
  ops (`/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/database/pool`) and is owned by no
  descriptor. `reporting.openapi.yaml` owns two tags (`Management Reporting` +
  `Reporting Projections`) because the `reporting` module owns both.

Neither the root fragment nor a module fragment is independently valid OpenAPI:
fragments reference shared components (`$ref:
"#/components/schemas/ApiError"`, `"#/components/responses/BadRequest"`, etc.)
that only resolve once every fragment is merged into one document.

Each base module points at its own fragment via
`ModuleDescriptor.api.openApiPath` in its `src/modules/<module>/module.ts` —
that is also what `module-management`'s readiness check reads to confirm the
module documents its API. Pointing it at the generated bundle instead is now a
gate failure: it both overstates what the module declares and leaves the real
fragment claimed by nobody, which is how a fragment for the `news_portal`
module outlived that module's retirement (ADR-0044).

## Changing the contract

1. Edit the owning module's fragment in
   `openapi/modules/<module>.openapi.yaml` for anything
   path/operation/module-schema-shaped. Edit `openapi/awcms-public-api.src.yaml`
   instead for anything genuinely shared (a new security scheme, a new shared
   header parameter, a schema two-or-more modules need) — **and for every new
   tag**: an operation whose tag is not declared there never reaches the
   reference document.
2. Regenerate the bundle and the readable reference:
   ```bash
   bun run openapi:bundle
   bun run api:docs:generate
   ```
3. Validate everything (bundle freshness, route parity, operationId uniqueness,
   path-parameter matching, standard error schema, security metadata, and the
   AsyncAPI baseline):
   ```bash
   bun run api:spec:check
   bun run api:docs:check
   ```
4. Commit **all three** in the same PR: the source fragment(s) you edited, the
   regenerated `awcms-public-api.openapi.yaml`, and the regenerated
   `docs/awcms/api-reference.md`. `api:spec:check` fails the build if the
   committed bundle is stale relative to the fragments; `api:docs:check` fails
   if the reference doc is stale.

Both `bun run openapi:bundle` and `bun run api:spec:check` run entirely offline
against files already in the repo — no network access, no external CLI.

**No same-line trailing comments on a plain (unquoted) scalar** (Issue #786):
YAML's plain-scalar grammar treats a whitespace-preceded `#` as a comment
start wherever it appears, including in the middle of prose — so
`description: Issue #591 fixed this` silently parses as `description: Issue`,
with everything from ` #591` onward dropped, not an error. `bun run
openapi:bundle`/`api:spec:check` now detects this shape and fails the build
naming the file and field — but it cannot tell "you meant that `#` to be part
of the text" from "you wrote a genuine, unrelated same-line comment after a
correct value"; both look identical to the parser. Either way the fix is the
same: quote the whole scalar with double quotes (`description: "Issue #591
fixed this"`), or move a genuine comment onto its own line above the field
instead of trailing it.

## What `api:spec:check` verifies (`scripts/api-spec-check.ts`)

- **Bundle freshness** — the committed bundle byte-matches what
  `bun run openapi:bundle` produces right now from the source fragments (catches
  a fragment edited without a re-bundle AND a hand-edited bundle). Bundling also
  throws `BundleConflictError` on a duplicate path/schema across fragments —
  including a derived fragment trying to override a base path/operation/schema.
- **Route parity** — every `/api/v1/**` route file's template matches an
  OpenAPI path, and every OpenAPI path has a route file (or an explicit
  `ROUTE_PARITY_EXEMPTIONS` entry — empty today).
- **Public operation allow-list** — every `security: []` operation is listed in
  `ALLOWED_PUBLIC_OPERATIONS`, and every allow-list entry is actually used.
- **Operation security metadata** — every operation states its security
  requirement explicitly (a real requirement, or `security: []` plus an
  allow-list entry).
- **operationId uniqueness** — every `operationId` in the bundled spec is
  globally unique.
- **Path parameters** — every `{param}` in a path template has exactly one
  matching `in: path` parameter, and vice versa.
- **Standard error schema** — every non-2xx/3xx response resolves (directly, via
  `components.responses`, or through `allOf`/`oneOf`/`anyOf`) to the shared
  `ApiError` schema — never an ad-hoc inline error shape.
- **Tag catalog integrity, both directions** — every operation carries at least
  one tag, every operation tag is declared in the root catalog, and every
  declared tag is carried by at least one operation. The third rule is not
  symmetry for its own sake: it is what catches a catalog that keeps announcing
  a retired module's surface, which is exactly half of the defect this gate was
  written for.
- **Fragment ownership, both directions** — every registered module's
  `api.openApiPath` names an existing file under `openapi/modules/` (never the
  generated bundle), no two modules claim the same fragment, and every fragment
  is claimed by exactly one registered module. `foundation.openapi.yaml` is the
  single reviewed exception (`MODULE_LESS_FRAGMENTS`), since it belongs to no
  module by design.

## Derived-application fragments

A derived (downstream ERP) repository contributes its own module fragments
without editing any base fragment — see
[`docs/awcms/api-contribution-guide.md`](../docs/awcms/api-contribution-guide.md)
and ADR-0026. Its module declares `api.openApiPath` pointing at its own
fragment; the derived build feeds every registered module's `openApiPath` to
`buildBundledDocument`'s `extraFragmentFiles` seam. A fragment that redefines a
base path/schema is rejected, never silently applied.

## Readable reference documentation

[`docs/awcms/api-reference.md`](../docs/awcms/api-reference.md) is a GENERATED,
human-readable Markdown reference — built from the bundled OpenAPI file plus the
AsyncAPI file by `bun run api:docs:generate` (`scripts/api-docs-generate.ts`),
with synthetic (never real) example values. `bun run api:docs:check` (part of
`bun run check`) fails the build if it's stale.
