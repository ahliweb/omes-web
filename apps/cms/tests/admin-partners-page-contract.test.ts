/**
 * `/admin/partners` gates against the endpoints it drives — ADR-0089/0090.
 *
 * Sibling of the other page-contract tests, for the same silent failure: a page
 * gating on a permission key no migration seeds hides the control from EVERYONE
 * — including the owner — while still looking like a working screen. This repo
 * has shipped that bug twice by inventing a plausible action name.
 *
 * This screen sets two traps of its own:
 *
 * - **Engaging and severing share ONE permission**, `partner_access.configure`.
 *   A page that gated Sever on a `partner_access.delete` it invented would hide
 *   the control that ENDS another organisation's access — from the person most
 *   likely to be reaching for it in a hurry.
 * - **Approving and revoking share `partner_access.assign`**, not `create` and
 *   not `revoke`. The permission is the authority to hand a role to somebody
 *   outside, and taking it back is the same authority.
 *
 * It also pins the two properties that are the point of the whole surface: the
 * access code is never re-fetched, and there is no partner directory.
 *
 * Pure — no database, no network. Runs in `quality` on every PR.
